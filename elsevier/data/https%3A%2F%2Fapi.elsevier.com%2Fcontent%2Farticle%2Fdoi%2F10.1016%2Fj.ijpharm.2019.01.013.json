Graphical abstract Abstract Oral tablets are a convenient form to deliver active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and have a high level of acceptance from clinicians and patients. There is a wide range of excipients available for the fabrication of tablets thereby offering a versatile platform for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the gastrointestinal tract. However, the geometry of tablets is limited by conventional manufacturing processes. This study aimed to compare three manufacturing processes in the production of flat-faced oral tablets using the same formulation composed of a polymer blend and caffeine as a model drug: fused-filament fabrication (FFF), direct compression (DC) and injection molding (IM). Hot-melt extrusion was used to convert a powder blend into feedstock material for FFF and IM processes, while DC was performed on the powder mixture. Tablets were produced with the same dimensions and were characterized for their physical and dissolution properties. There were statistical differences in the physical properties and drug release profiles of the tablets produced by the different manufacturing processes. DC tablets displayed immediate release, IM provided sustained release over 48\u202fh, and FFF tablets displayed both release types depending on the printing parameters. FFF continues to demonstrate high potential as a manufacturing process for the efficient production of personalized oral tablets.

After ingestion by the patient, oral tablets are exposed to severe conditions in which the drug must withstand the digestive process and penetrate through the gastrointestinal barrier to the bloodstream (Mitra et al., 2013). Conventional tablets are composed of powder blends of one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) along with protective and functional excipients that undergo direct compression in single or multiple steps into compressed solid cylinders (Qiu et al., 2017). Compressed tablets can also have multiple layers to permit the independent delivery of multiple drugs (Vaithiyalingam and Sayeed, 2010). Several factors govern the successful production of a compressed tablet. Proper powder handling is essential as it is involved in every aspect of tablet production. Powder flow is dependent on interparticle interactions and decreases with increasing cohesiveness of the powder. Particle size is vital to overall tablet quality having influence over powder flow, compressibility, content and weight uniformity, drug release, and dissolution (Virtanen et al., 2010). Compactibility is defined as the ability of a powdered mixture under compression to form a stable tablet (Gad, 2007). Under compaction at high pressure powdered blends forms strong bonds between particles. A stable tablet will maintain such bonds during decompression, while unstable tablets will undergo cracking and crumbling due to elastic recovery (Hiestand, 1997). Due to these prerequisite properties for direct compression, less than 20% of drug compounds are suitable candidates for this type of tablet (Li et al., 2017). Direct compression as a manufacturing process for the production of tablets offers several advantages. Fewer processing steps and less equipment needed when compared to granulation processes as well as a heatless and dry production process, which increases product stability. The process also allows for the administration of all classes of therapeutic agents, except proteins and faster release rates than its wet granulated counterparts (Jones, 2016). While direct compression is a well understood, highly repeatable process, it is limited in the type of tablet geometries it can generate. Most tablets are circular solid cylinders with either flat or convex faces, with or without edging. Tablet geometry is a factor that can be harnessed to produce oral tablets with unique properties since surface area and volume of an object is directly linked to shape. For example, donut-shaped oral tablets have demonstrated a zero-order release (Kim, 1995). Other issues is that therapeutic agents are not inherently compactable, so more excipients are required to produce reliable tablets, hence, limiting the drug loading achievable through this process (Jones, 2016). The comparison of drug dosage forms fabricated using hot-melt extrusion and direct compression is not new to the literature (Crowley et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2001; Loreti et al., 2014) and it is in the interest of this body of work to evaluate more innovative hot-melt processing techniques. Injection molding is a hot-melt extrusion based process that can readily produce complex parts to six-sigma accuracy and precision, and there is an established interest in the technology for the production of pharmaceutical dosage forms (Major et al., 2016; Quinten et al., 2009; Zema et al., 2012). It is a manufacturing process involving rapid mold filling under high pressure followed by rapid cooling and part ejection. The injection molding machine is composed of two main sections \u2013 a plasticizing unit that melts, conveys and injects thermoplastic material, and mold tooling which cools and shapes the molten thermoplastic into a part. In most instances, injection molding is combined with a twin-screw HME process as a first step in the production of pharmaceutical dosage forms (Boyd et al., 2014; Claeys et al., 2012; Desai et al., 2017; Major et al., 2013; Mc Conville et al., 2012; McConville et al., 2016, 2012; Quinten et al., 2012). Twin-screw HME provides for the better dispersion of API in the polymer matrix than what is provided by the single-screw in an injection molding machine (Maniruzzaman et al., 2012). However, it is not a requisite to melt process formulations for injection molding applications. The literature offers examples of direct feeding of powder blends for the manufacture of drug dosage forms via injection molding (Cuff and Raouf, 1999; Eggenreich et al., 2016), including continuous manufacturing processes (Mascia et al., 2013; Melocchi et al., 2015). The technology is also being investigated for tablet coating applications (Desai et al., 2018; Puri et al., 2018). Among other technologies evaluated for the fabrication of oral tablets, there is fused-filament fabrication (FFF), a three-dimensional (3D) printing process that requires HME for the fabrication of thermoplastic filament feedstock (Alhnan et al., 2016; Feuerbach et al., 2018; Zema et al., 2017). A stepper motor feeds this filament to an extrusion head consisting of a liquefier (a heated chamber), and a nozzle that deposits molten polymer along a coordinate on the XYZ axis. In general, the range of materials available for non-medical FFF applications is limited, with only thirty materials available commercially compared to over three thousand for the other HME based processes like injection molding (Evans, 2016) and currently, no material has been made commercially available for the FFF of drug products. Researchers have two main approaches to creating drug-loaded filament \u2013 impregnation of commercial filament (Goyanes et al., 2015a, 2014; Tagami et al., 2017) and HME production of filament from FFF suitable materials like polyvinyl alcohol (Gioumouxouzis et al., 2017; Goyanes et al., 2016b, 2015c, 2015d; Melocchi et al., 2016) and polylactic acid (Goyanes et al., 2016a; Kempin et al., 2017; Melocchi et al., 2016; Wilson and Mills, 2015). Although several pharmaceutical grade polymers have been extensively evaluated for FFF applications in recent years, further work is required to sufficiently modify suitable polymers for the FFF process so that technology can be expanded to suit a broader range of both drug compounds and clinical indications. Recently we described the utilization of melt-blending to overcome the inherent restrictions in the FFF process (Fuenmayor et al., 2018), and other researchers are investigating similar avenues (Alhijjaj et al., 2016; Solanki et al., 2018). Despite the technical hurdles, there is a growing interest in the utilization of the technology for pharmaceutical applications (Jamr\u00f3z et al., 2017; Norman et al., 2017; Prasad and Smyth, 2016). Researchers have investigated the use of the process to make oral dosage forms such as tablets (Beck et al., 2017; Chai et al., 2017; Goyanes et al., 2015b, 2015c, 2014; Long et al., 2017; Okwuosa et al., 2016; Solanki et al., 2018; Verstraete et al., 2018), caplets (Goyanes et al., 2016b, 2015d), among other more intricate geometries, compositions and functions (Genina et al., 2017; Maroni et al., 2017; Melocchi et al., 2015; Sadia et al., 2018). Other than the ready production of tablets with complex shapes, a primary driver for the technology is the possibility of the tailored dosage forms to enable the personalisation of treatment (Konta et al., 2017). The purpose of this study was to directly compare FFF to both DC and IM in the production of flat-faced oral tablets. Tablets were successfully fabricated via all three manufacturing methods using the same formulation and drug loading. The produced tablets were characterized for their mechanical and thermal properties as well as drug release kinetics. A total of twelve different batches of tablets were obtained, ten batches of FFF tablets made with different printing parameters, one batch of DC tablets produced using standard compression parameters and one batch IM tablets produced using standard molding parameters. These batches of tablets were tested for their dimensional accuracy, weight variation, friability, hardness, surface morphology, thermal and melt-flow properties, drug content uniformity and API release kinetics using media simulating fasting stomach conditions. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Polycaprolactone (PCL) in powder form (Capa 6506, average Mw\u202f=\u202f50,000) was obtained from Perstop (Cheshire, UK). Kollidon\u00ae VA64 (PVP-VA) was purchased from BASF Ireland (Cork, Ireland). Poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) (average Mw\u202f=\u202f300,000) in powder form was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Arklow, Ireland). The model drug for dissolution studies was USP grade caffeine which was purchased from VWR International (Dublin, Ireland). Table 1 shows the formulation used in this study. 2.2 Hot-melt extrusion All excipients were passed through a 450\u202f\u00b5m sieve to obtain equivalent particle sizes and then mixed for 15\u202fmin at 50 RPM using a Universal Motor Drive 400 (Pharmag GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) attached to a cube mixer. An MP19TC25 APV Baker 19\u202fmm co-rotating twin screw extruder (Newcastle-under-Lyme, UK) equipped with a purpose-built filament forming die was used for the compounding of the filament. The filament die has a conical shaped cavity, narrowing away from the extruder finishing in a circular orifice (diameter 2.30\u202fmm). The processing parameters are detailed in Table 2 . The extruded materials were hauled off using a tilted conveyor air cooled Teflon\u00ae belt and a counter-rotating belt haul-off with sufficient speed to maintain a filament diameter of 1.75\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.15\u202fmm necessary for the FFF 3D printing process. The filament was granulated using a strand pelletizer SGS 50-E (Reduction Engineering Scheer, Ohio, USA) into 3\u202fmm granules for injection molding. Fig. 1 is a process flowchart detailing the flow of materials into the three different processes. 2.3 Fused-filament fabrication A MakerBot Replicator 2X (Makerbot\u00ae Industries, New York, USA) 3D printer was used for the production of FFF tablets. The optimal printing conditions of the blend were determined via preliminary trials and kept constant at: extrusion speed (10\u202fmm/s), extruder temperature (150\u202f\u00b0C), printing bed temperature (50\u202f\u00b0C), extruder travel speed (50\u202fmm/s), number of shells (1), roof and floor thickness (0.5\u202fmm), layer height (0.2\u202fmm) and the raft and support options turned off. Three different printing parameters were varied to evaluate the effect on the drug release and tablet properties. Four different values were chosen for the infill percentage (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) and layer height (0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4\u202fmm). Four infill patterns (linear, diamond, moroccanstar and hexagonal) were considered. Generic FFF values were set at 25% infill with a linear pattern and 0.2\u202fmm layer height. The breakdown of different printed tablets is displayed in Table 3 . The three-dimensional design for the tablet was created using SolidWorks\u00ae 2014 (Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, Waltham, USA) and saved as an STL extension format (Fig.\u202f2 a). The STL file was opened using the monitor and remote control software suite MakerBot Desktop version 3.5 (Makerbot\u00ae Industries, New York, USA). 2.4 Injection molding Injection molding was carried out on an Arburg\u2122 Allrounder 370 E (Arburg GmbH, Germany) equipped with an Arburg\u2122 170 injection unit. The required temperature profile was established on the Arburg\u2122 Allrounder 370 E injection molding by means of 5 temperature controllers placed along the length of the barrel with an additional controller used to regulate the temperature at the nozzle. The shot size was determined at a stroke of 22\u202fmm based on the total volume of material necessary per shot to fill all runners, gates and part cavities, values that were obtained via SolidWorks\u00ae plastics flow simulator (Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, France). The injection molding parameters (Table 4 ) were optimised for the formulation prior to tablet production. A mold was specifically designed to produce tablets with exact geometry the FFF and DC tablets. Solidworks plastics add-on was used to evaluate the efficiency of different mold designs. Fig.\u202f2b depicts the three-dimensional drawing and front view of the final mold design used in this work. Two insert molds were manufactured via SLA printing on a Viper SI2 SLA\u00ae system (3D systems GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) using Somos\u00ae GP Plus 14122 (DSM Functional Materials, Netherlands) as a feedstock material for the manufacture of the mold, using a resolution of 0.1\u202fmm. The mold was introduced into a full stainless steel cavity mold, which has two orifices that serve as slots for the attachment of small insert molds. 2.5 Direct compression The tablet press used was a manual laboratory hydraulic press (Specac Limited, UK) capable of 15 tons of pressure. The die was a hardened stainless steel evacuable pellet die Specac GS03000 (Specac Limited, UK) that produces tablets with a diameter of 13\u202fmm. Approximately 500\u202fmg of powder formulation was accurately weighed on a Sartorius analytical balance (Sartorius, Germany) and fed into the die. This amount of material was demonstrated to produce tablets with a height of 4\u202fmm during preliminary trials. The die and plunger were put on top of the powder, and a 5-ton pressure was applied to the mixture for 30\u202fs. 2.6 Melt flow indexing Melt flow indexing (MFI) was performed to evaluate the rheological properties of the material. The melt flow rates (MFR) were measured using a Zwick Roell Cflow extrusion plastometer with a 2\u202fmm orifice die. All testing was performed with a fixed weight of 2.16\u202fkg following the guidelines of the ASTM standard D1238-13. The temperature range for the test extended from 110\u202f\u00b0C up to 160\u202f\u00b0C in 10\u202f\u00b0C increments. 2.7 Differential scanning calorimetry Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed for thermal characterization of material blends and fabricated tablets, using a TA Instruments DSC 2920 Differential Scanning Calorimeter (Dublin, Ireland). Samples weighed between 8 and 12\u202fmg and were placed in non-hermetical aluminium pans, which were crimped prior to testing with an empty crimped aluminium pan for reference. Each sample was subjected to a heating cycle to remove thermal history consisting of a ramp from room temperature to 300\u202f\u00b0C at a rate of 10\u202f\u00b0C/min. This was followed by a cooling cycle down to 0\u202f\u00b0C at a rate of 5\u202f\u00b0C/min. Data recording was activated, and the temperature was ramped at a rate of 10\u202f\u00b0C/min until 300\u202f\u00b0C was reached. 2.8 Scanning electron microscopy Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Mira SEM (Tescan Oxford Instruments, UK) using a range of magnifications to evaluate the surface morphology of the tablets and drug using the secondary electrons function. Tablets from the three different manufacturing processes were snap broken through the transversal plane and cross-sectional areas put under the microscope along with powder from caffeine that was left placed in an oven at 140\u202f\u00b0C for 12\u202fmin to simulate the thermal conditions that the drug withstand during the HME process. As a first step, the samples were placed on an aluminium stub and were gold coated using Baltec SCD 005 sputter coater (BAL-TEC GmbH, Germany) for 110\u202fs at 0.1\u202fmBar vacuum before observation. 2.9 Tablet hardness Each formulation underwent tablet hardness testing according to USP <1217> using a Schleuniger Pharmatron Model 6D Tablet Tester (Solothurn, Switzerland). The tablets were selected at random with each tablet being placed into the hardness tester and the maximum force-to-break (Newton) was measured. The mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviation for each formulation was calculated. 2.10 Tablet friability In order to determine the physical integrity of tablets, an auto-friability tester PTF E/ER (Pharma Test Apparatebau GmbH, Hainburg, Germany) was utilised. Following the USP standard 32-NF 27, tablets were laid in a sieve and using a soft brush; any dust was removed from them. Then tablets were weighted until their combined weight was equal or greater than 6.5\u202fg and introduced into a drum rotated at a speed of 25\u202f\u00b1\u202f1 RPM for 4\u202fmin. Tablets were removed and brushed again to remove any dust and reweighed. The loss in the weight of the tablet is the measure of friability and was calculated by dividing the loss in weight by the initial weight and multiplying in it by a 100: (1) Percentage friability % = Los s i n weight Initial weight \u00d7 100 2.11 Drug release studies Dissolution testing of tablets (n\u202f=\u202f6) was performed on Distek dissolution system 2100B with a Distek temperature control system TCS 0200B (Distek Inc., USA) according to USP Dissolution Apparatus I. The dissolution media (900\u202fmL per vessel) was 0.2\u202fM hydrochloric acid, pH 1.2 (37\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202f\u00b0C) to mimic the stomach conditions during fasting with the stir rate being 50 RPM. At predetermined time intervals, 5\u202fmL was withdrawn from each vessel and replaced with pre-heated media. The withdrawn samples were filtered through 0.45\u202f\u00b5m filter and drug release determined at 272\u202fnm by performing UV spectroscopy using a Shimadzu UV-1280 UV\u2013VIS spectrophotometer which was blanked with a solution of the buffer and dissolved polymers, accordingly to the formulation being tested in order to secure the detection of caffeine. The dissolution profile was observed from a plot of time versus absorbance. 2.12 High-performance liquid chromatography High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the content uniformity of caffeine abiding by the standard USP 28 Uniformity of Dosage units. Ten tablets per manufacturing process were randomly selected, weighed and dissolved in 5\u202fmL of chloroform. The solution was then mixed with methanol until 50\u202fmL was obtained. The solutions were centrifuged and injected into HPLC grade vials using a syringe equipped with Nylon 66 0.2\u202f\u00b5m filters. The HPLC equipment was a Waters 1515 Isocratic HPLC pump which was connected to an in-line vacuum degasser, Waters 717plus Autosampler and a Waters 2487 Dual Absorbance Detector. The data were collected and integrated using Empower\u00ae Version 2.0 software. The column was a Luna C18(2), 5\u202f\u00b5M, 150\u202f\u00d7\u202f4.6\u202fmm, equipped with a precolumn Security Guard Cartridge C18, 4.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.0\u202fmm, (Phenomenex Inc., UK). The mobile phase consisted of water:methanol:glacial acetic acid (69:28:3), which was vacuum filtered through a Nylon 66 0.2\u202f\u00b5m filter (Agilent Technologies, Ireland). The flow rate of the mobile phase was 2.0\u202fmL/min with an injection volume of 10\u202f\u00b5L. 2.13 Statistical analysis Data handling and analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., UK). Test data was inputted into the software, and mean, and standard deviation values were calculated for replicate sets of data. The significance threshold was set at 0.05. Error bars represent standard deviation unless otherwise specified in the figure caption. The mean values are presented in the figures in the results section. Multiple comparisons among subgroups were performed using a Bonferroni post-hoc test to differentiate drug release curves. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Manufacturing observations This work aimed to directly compare FFF 3D printing of flat-faced oral tablets with the well-established DC approach and a second HME based manufacturing process IM. The same formulation was used for all three processes, and physical, thermal and dissolution properties of the resulting tablets were compared. We previously described the development of this formulation (Fuenmayor et al., 2018) as we set about modifying the properties of Kollidon \u00ae VA64 (vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer) to increase printability for FFF. By melt-blending with PCL and PEO, we were able to decrease filament brittleness and stiffness sufficiently to print complete batches of flat-faced tablets. Each polymer in this ternary blend has previously been used for the fabrication of oral tablets (Diaf et al., 2012; Eyjolfsson, 2015; Kim, 1998; Ma et al., 2013) but to the best of our knowledge not as a blend. Pestle and mortar were implemented to balance size distribution and reduce the particle size of the powder formulation. A 450\u202f\u00b5m sieve was the smallest that could be used successfully. The powder blend was mixed to improve homogeneity and stored in an oven at 40\u202f\u00b0C overnight before processing to remove moisture. For the fabrication of DC tablets, 500\u202fmg powder mix was fed into a compression die to produce each tablet. The resulting tablets were coarse in appearance and to the touch. Particle size distribution for PCL and PEO is 98%\u202f<\u202f600\u202f\u00b5m and 96%\u202f<\u202f841\u202f\u00b5m respectively while caffeine particles are mostly below 420\u202f\u00b5m in size (95%). The particle size differences between powders can result in a polydisperse and moderately coarse formulation in which PVP-VA is relatively smaller in particle size (15%\u202f<\u202f50\u202f\u00b5m 2%\u202f>\u202f250\u202f\u00b5m), resulting in a mixture with poor fluidity and compactability due to variations on the particle size distribution (Eyjolfsson, 2015; Yajima et al., 1996). Only one batch of DC tablets was produced using standard compression parameters to compare to the FFF tablets. An HME twin-screw compounding process converted the powder formulation into a suitable feedstock for FFF (extrudate filament strand) and IM (pelletized extrudate filament\u202f<\u202f3\u202fmm). HME was performed at temperatures below the melting temperature of caffeine (235\u202f\u00b0C), and therefore the drug should have remained in the crystalline state unless solubilized by the molten polymer blend. Addition of drug during extrusion did not affect extruder torque (Fuenmayor et al., 2018), and melt flow indexing of the polymer blend did not change on drug addition and remained around 10.5\u202fg/10\u202fmin\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.02 at 150\u202f\u00b0C. Melt flow index data had also previously indicated that FFF nozzle temperature should be set to least at 150\u202f\u00b0C (Fuenmayor et al., 2018) or higher for this polymer blend formulation as the optimal MFI value for FFF layer deposition should be +10\u202fg/10\u202fmin (Wang et al., 2018). The nozzle temperature was kept constant throughout printing of all ten batches of FFF tablets with only the specific printing parameters changing between batches. Extrudate filaments were pelletized and then gravity fed to the injection molding machine to mold tablets using a temperature profile similar to HME at first. However, this resulted in short-shots which can be attributed to too low a melt temperature (Moayyedian et al., 2017). A subsequent trial at higher temperatures (Table 4) produced tablets with excellent surface finish and dimensional accuracy. 3.2 Physical appearance Flat-faced tablets were produced via FFF with different printing parameters to understand the effect of each variable on physical and dissolution properties. Infill percentage defines the inner density of a 3DP part. Infill pattern is the layer deposition arrangement during printing. FFF parts are built by depositing horizontal layers of molten material on top of each other, and the thickness of such layers is called layer height. Fig. 3 displays the inner structure of FFF tablets with different infill patterns and infill percentages. Fig.\u202f3a-\u2013d\u2013 display parts fabricated using increasing infill percentages (25%, 50%, 75% and 100% respectively) and it is clear the reduction of empty space inside parts as the percentage increases. The diamond infill pattern (Fig.\u202f3e) had inner walls meeting at a 90\u00b0-degree angle. Tablets with a hexagonal infill pattern (Fig.\u202f3f) had the thickest inner walls out of the four infill patterns used in this study. The moroccanstar infill pattern (Fig.\u202f3g) was composed of a succession of irregular eight-sided stars and octagons. The linear infill pattern (Fig.\u202f3h) had a geometrical organization of inner walls similar to the diamond infill pattern, but the space between them was smaller due to a denser distribution of lines. The surface morphology differences between the three different processes are evident from SEM scans presented in Fig. 4 . DC tablets (Fig.\u202f4a\u2013c) had a coarse surface with no clear phase differentiation, and on higher magnification (Fig.\u202f4b) monoclinic caffeine is apparent. Sponge-like surfaces appear to be engulfing these drug crystals, and it is assumed that it corresponds to PEO domains (Fuenmayor et al., 2018). Fig.\u202f4d\u2013f depict the cross-sectional area of an FFF tablet with 25% infill and 0.2\u202fmm layers. The crisscrossing of deposited layers and the space between them is observable in this picture, and the presence of crystalline caffeine more homogenously distributed. Spongy domains in FFF tablets are observed in Fig.\u202f4f with a more pronounced colour difference than those in Fig.\u202f4b for the DC tablet. The cross-sectional area of tablets fabricated using 100% infill (FFF4) are depicted next (Fig.\u202f4g\u2013i). Here it is observable the difference in material density when compare to FFF1 with a compact solid structure, however, evidence of horizontal layer deposition is found in Fig.\u202f4g. Drug crystals are only observable when closely inspecting Fig.\u202f4i and there seems to be a more chaotic distribution of the material phases when compared to other samples. The SEM images of the IM tablets are displayed in Fig.\u202f4j\u2013l. Drug crystals are present but are not as pronounced as those found in the FFF1 and DC tablets, and the crystals are more evenly distributed than in the other three tablets. Fig.\u202f4m\u2013o are images of the unprocessed caffeine powder, which shows a less pronounced monoclinic structure compared to the processed caffeine within the tablets, which have more a needle-like appearance, particularly in the FFF tablets. Conclusions about the inner morphological structure of the tablets can be drawn based on these images. Compressed tablets depend on particle bonding and area of contact, plastic deformation and tensile properties to guarantee physical integrity and a successful production process (Jivraj et al., 2000). Differences in particle size, agglomeration and poor tensile properties could explain the observed lack of surface homogeneity for Fig.\u202f4a\u2013c. Conversely, during melt processing, polymer chains are disentangled by means of heat and shear forces (Li et al., 2014), and they are rearranged while the material melt is cooling down which results in a more homogenous continuous inner structure as observable in Fig.\u202f4d\u2013i. 3.3 Physical properties The variations in weight between FFF samples were evaluated, and the results are presented in Fig. 5 . Infill percentage had a greater influence on tablet weight, and this is to be expected since infill percentage increases the amount of material deposited. However, there was no significant difference in the weight of 75% (FFF3) and 100% (FFF4) infill tablets (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). For the infill pattern, only linear (FFF1) and moroccanstar (FFF5) had no significant difference in their weight (p\u202f<\u202f0.01), while tablets produced with different layer heights showed no significant (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) difference between the four tablets (FFF1, FFF8, FFF9 and FFF10). The weight comparison of tablets produced using different manufacturing methods is presented in Fig. 6 . The differences in tablet weights are significant (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). The higher weight of IM tablet is a consequence of parts produced using this technique having a considerably higher density (Rothen-Weinhold et al., 1999). FFF tablets have a greater free volume within the inner structure due to the infill percentage used for their fabrication (25%). Even the FFF4 tablet with the highest infill (100%) produced in this study had a lower weight than the IM tablet, which is an indication of the matrix porosity differences between samples produced using these methods (Verstraete et al., 2018). As for the tablets physical integrity, all FFF tablets retained their full weight after the friability test. Only DC tablets failed the friability test, and this again could be explained through the differences in particle size of components. Future studies should modify the formulation for the compression of tablets or achieve a more homogenous particle size distribution to improve the compactability of the formulation. Results of tablet hardness for FFF tablets are depicted in Fig. 7 . Infill percentage seems to have the most substantial effect on tablet hardness, with FFF3 (75%) and FFF4 (100%) exceeding the maximum limit of the test. There was no significant difference between these tablets and FFF2 (50%). Layer height again had no significant effect on tablet hardness. Infill pattern had a significant effect on tablet hardness. The more symmetrical patterns of linear (FFF1), hexagonal (FFF6) and diamond (FFF7) provided greater resistance to the compression forces. The irregular inner geometry of the moroccanstar (FFF5) could explain its poorer mechanical performance since more regular lattice-type structures have a greater load-bearing capacity (Rosen et al., 2006). Tablet hardness of the three different manufacturing processes can be found in Fig. 8 . The IM tablets failed to deform or break during this test, while the DC tablets needed 176.73\u202fN to break and crumbled apart during testing. Although FFF tablets had the lowest hardness value, they only deformed during testing and did not chip or break apart. 3.4 Thermal properties Fig. 9 shows the DSC thermograms for tablets manufactured using three different manufacturing processes. A single melting peak is observed for all polymer blends followed by a relaxation of around 100\u202f\u00b0C which corresponds to the PVP-VA glass transition. The temperatures of the transitions observed in Fig. 9 are reported in Table 5 . The presence of separate transitions in a ternary blend formulation would suggest only partial miscibility between the excipients (Mofokeng and Luyt, 2015), and further data in our previous study of this polymer blend formulation would suggest this to be the case (Fuenmayor et al., 2018). The presence of caffeine was observed for DC tablets by a small melting peak at 240\u202f\u00b0C but was not observed for the FFF and IM tablets. The absence of a DSC peak could because the drug was more evenly dispersed in the polymer matrix (as shown by the SEM images) or even partially solubilized during HME (Alshahrani et al., 2015; Huang and Dai, 2014). Another possibility could be the creation of a solid amorphous dispersion during the melt-processing stage of this project (Sarode et al., 2013). 3.5 Drug release Fig. 10 shows the drug content uniformity for FFF, DC and IM tablets. DC tablets had a 118.0% drug content when compared to the label claim with a standard deviation of 16.6%. Thus, failing to pass the USP uniformity of content test. Conversely, both FFF and IM tablets passed the test with drug contents of 103.9% (SD\u202f=\u202f8.7%) and 98.2% (SD\u202f=\u202f5.7%) respectively. The content uniformity difference between DC tablets and the other two tablet types is related to the better drug dispersion and enhanced mixing due to the twin-screw HME processing step before both IM and FFF tablet manufacture (Maniruzzaman et al., 2012; Thiry et al., 2015). The powder formulations were carefully handled and mixed before the DC process, but there is a possibility for the mixture not to be homogenous, due to the large variation in particle size of the ingredients, causing variations in the actual content of DC tablets. The HME processing step can be added prior to direct compression to improve drug content uniformity. Compressed tablets have previously been formed from the milled powder or granules of melt-extruded blends (Andrews et al., 2008; Lakshman et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2001; Verstraete et al., 2016a). Similarly, Baronsky-Probst et al. (Baronsky-Probst et al., 2016) described the production of tamper-resistant prolonged release tablets made by the direct compaction of melt-extruded rods. The influence of FFF parameters and manufacturing processes on the drug dissolution properties of oral tablets in fasted stomach conditions was evaluated in vitro. Layer height influence on drug delivery is shown in Fig. 11 . Tablets produced with 0.3\u202fmm (FFF9) and 0.4\u202fmm (FFF10) layer heights released 88% and 92% drug content after 24\u202fh respectively. This prolonged release of the drug is hypothesized to be related to the permeability and porosity of tablets. Reducing the layer height creates a more tortuous arrangement over the same volume, slowing the rate of media flushing through the dosage form, thus delaying the drug release (Crowley et al., 2004). Tablets manufactured using 0.2\u202fmm (FFF1) layers provided slower release with only 45% released after 8\u202fh. The difference in drug release for all three groups was not significant after the 8\u202fh time point (p\u202f>\u202f0.05), which is due to the release media having imbibed into the tablets negating the differences in permeability and porosity, while FFF9 and FFF10 were not significantly different from each other (p\u202f>\u202f0.05) over the 48\u202fh. Drug release properties for tablets fabricated using different infill patterns is presented in Fig. 12 . There was no clear difference between the three infill patterns in the first 8\u202fh. Linear (FFF1), moroccanstar (FFF5) and diamond (FFF7) did not display a significant difference in drug release up to 8\u202fh. After this point, there was a clear divergence between linear (FFF1) and the moroccanstar (FFF5) and diamond (FFF7) tablets, with the linear (FFF1) tablets releasing more than 90% of their drug content after 48\u202fh while the other two tablets released just over 70% in the same time. Release from the hexagonal (FFF6) tablet was not significantly different to the diamond (FFF7) tablet. Infill percentage has previously been demonstrated to have an inverse relationship to drug release (Verstraete et al., 2018), and similar results were obtained during this study (Fig. 13 ). A higher infill percentage will decrease the inner porosity of tablets which in return will decrease the permeability of the media. Samples fabricated using 75% infill (FFF3) had the slowest release rate with only 26% drug content released after 8\u202fh, while 50% infill tablets (FFF2) released 32% of drug content at this time point. After 24\u202fh drug release for these tablets increased to 50% for 75% infill (FFF3) and 61% for 50% infill (FFF2). Fig. 14 shows the cumulative drug release for the tablets produced using the three different manufacturing processes. DC tablets had burst release characteristics with 95% of drug content present in the media after 6\u202fh. The FFF tablet provided a more sustained release with 38% and 80% released after 6 and 24\u202fh respectively. After 48\u202fh the FFF tablet released 92% drug content. The IM tablet would be considered an extended-release tablet displaying the slowest drug release (64% after 48\u202fh) for samples evaluated in this study. During HME, materials are softened and/or melted while having to withstand high shear forces. This generates high pressures compacting the mixture and intertwining the molecular chains of the polymers creating a highly tortuous structure and reducing the porosity of the materials (Crowley et al., 2004; Rubio and Ghaly, 1994; Zhang et al., 2001) This combination of factors explain the sustained release displayed by the tablets produce via FFF and IM. IM had the highest weight of all samples produced, which suggest a highly dense matrix (Rothen-Weinhold et al., 1999). In work by Verstraete et al. (2018, 2016a, 2016b), it was demonstrated the higher porosity of IM tablets when compared to FFF tablets. The increased porosity accelerates the drug release via two methods, the first is facilitating access of dissolution media through the tablet (Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2003) and the second is by enhancing the diffusion of solubilized drug molecules (Nerurkar et al., 2005). The differences in porosity are observable when comparing SEM scans of FFF tablets versus IM counterparts (Fig.\u202f4d, g and j). In Fig.\u202f4d, there is an abundance of free space as a result of the geometrical pattern used for depositing the material as well the thickness of horizontal layers used in the building process. Fig.\u202f4j in contrast, displays a more compact and multifaceted surface morphology, resembling a single wall of material instead of an arrangement of individual layers. Samples manufactured using 100% infill are dense and solid, and when comparing images of FFF4 versus IM tablets, the resemblance in their wavelike surface finish is appreciable. Nonetheless, as we increased the magnification of the images, the differences in their material density and porosity start arising. A quick glance of Fig.\u202f4l, when compared to Fig.\u202f4i, shows a more robust wall of material to prevent ingress of the dissolution media into the samples, thus slowing the diffusion of the drug. It is worth mentioning, that DC tablets dissolved fully in the media while all melt-processed tablets held their physical shape and had a mass loss of 30% from their initial weight before dissolution, corresponding to the hydrophilic portions of the formulation (data not shown). Using the same formulation but different processing methods produce different drug release profiles. However, there is evidence that the hot-melt processes delay drug release (Zhang et al., 2001). The influence of FFF parameters and manufacturing processes on the in vitro drug dissolution properties of oral tablets was tested in fasting stomach conditions. Figs. 11\u201313 demonstrate that different FFF parameters did affect the drug release properties. As for infill patterns, there was no significant difference between FFF5 (morrocanstar) and FFF7 (diamond); and FFF1 (linear) did not display a significant difference in its drug release up to 8\u202fh. Although FFF6 (hexagonal) had a more rapid release during the first 8\u202fh, the total amount released was similar to that of FFF5 and FFF7 (data not shown), and only FFF1 delivered more than 90% of its drug content after 48\u202fh. Only the linear infill pattern provided significantly different drug release to the other infill patterns. There were three different drug release profiles for the tablets across manufacturing processes. A burst release was observed for DC tablets, while a more controlled drug release was observed for tablets fabricated using melt processing methods. During the melt processing step needed to prepare samples for FFF and IM, materials are softened and/or molten while being subjected to shear along the barrel. The process generates high pressures compacting the mixture and intertwining the molecular chains of the polymers creating a highly tortuous structure and reducing the porosity of the materials when compared to samples obtained via compression (Crowley et al., 2004; Rubio and Ghaly, 1994; Zhang et al., 2001). This phenomenon is observable via SEM images of the cross-sectional area of tablets as well in the improved physical properties of the tablets when in comparison to DC tablets. This combination of factors explains the extended release kinetics displayed by the tablets produce via FFF and IM. 4 Conclusions New manufacturing technologies are being harnessed by the pharmaceutical industry to produce solid dosage forms. Hot-melt extrusion has been a key enabling technology to enhance drug solubility and bioavailability. Two HME based processes \u2013 injection molding and fused-filament fabrication are gaining interest as they both offer a means of producing complex dosage forms that cannot be readily made through more conventional means. This present study has clearly demonstrated tablets of the same physical dimensions and formulation can have very different physical and dissolution properties based on how they are produced. Each process has their advantages and disadvantages. DC has low capital investment and can better handle thermally labile drug compounds, but as we have demonstrated the excipients must have the correct powder properties to produce tablets within the USP limits. The substantially higher capital investment IM process readily manufactures complex shapes to tight tolerances, and we have also shown the process produces densely packed oral tablets with highly dispersed API with extended-release profiles. Although, a much slower process than both DC and IM, the 3D printing process fused-filament fabrication has demonstrated a greater ability to control drug release and tablet properties through simple adjustment of the printing parameters. By modifying layer height and infill percentage, it was possible to modify 24\u202fh drug release from 92% down to 50% without any changes to infrastructure, formulation or equipment. This kind of flexibility could make 3D printing process the key enabling technology for the modification of drug dosage forms for personalized treatment. Conflict of interest None.

There is a wide range of excipients available for the fabrication of tablets thereby offering a versatile platform for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the gastrointestinal tract. However, the geometry of tablets is limited by conventional manufacturing processes. This study aimed to compare three manufacturing processes in the production of flat-faced oral tablets using the same formulation composed of a polymer blend and caffeine as a model drug: fused-filament fabrication (FFF), direct compression (DC) and injection molding (IM). Hot-melt extrusion was used to convert a powder blend into feedstock material for FFF and IM processes, while DC was performed on the powder mixture. Tablets were produced with the same dimensions and were characterized for their physical and dissolution properties. There were statistical differences in the physical properties and drug release profiles of the tablets produced by the different manufacturing processes. DC tablets displayed immediate release, IM provided sustained release over 48\u202fh, and FFF tablets displayed both release types depending on the printing parameters. FFF continues to demonstrate high potential as a manufacturing process for the efficient production of personalized oral tablets.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2019-03-10", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037851731930047X", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fuenmayor, Evert"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Forde, Martin"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Healy, Andrew V."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Devine, Declan M."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Lyons, John G."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "McConville, Christopher"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Major, Ian"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037851731930047X"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037851731930047X"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0378-5173(19)30047-X", "prism:volume": "558", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier B.V.", "dc:title": "Comparison of fused-filament fabrication to direct compression and injection molding in the manufacture of oral tablets", "prism:copyright": "\u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
