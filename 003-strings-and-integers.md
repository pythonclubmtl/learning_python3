# Storing numbers

In programming, a string is a sequence of characters. These characters can be a literal constant (auch as a name we want to save) or some kind of variables.
In the previous section, we actually already used a string [in the last section](0002-using-pythonsell.md) when we assigned integer values (42, 24, 51) to the string `a`.
In this section, we are going to manipulate strings a bit more.


### Exercise 1:

We'll get started with a few exercises involving 

    In [1]: emily = 25952
    In [2]: hannah = 23073
    In [3]: khaleesi = 5
    In [4]: emily
    Out[4]: ______
    In [5]: hannah + 1
    Out[5]: ______
    In [6]: 3 * khaleesi
    Out[6]: ______

### Exercise 2:

Let's change the content. Insert the correct values and variable names into the blanks.

    In [7]: emily = emily + 1
    In [8]: emily
    Out[8]: _____

    In [9]: all_babies = 0
    In [10]: all_babies = _____ + _____ + _____
    In [11]: all_babies
    Out[11]: 49031

*If you like maths, you may sigh loud at the notion of redefining a variable every few lines.*

### Exercise 3:

Which of the following variable names are correct? Try assigning some numbers to them.

    Sarah
    ASHLEY
    madison alexis
    sam90
    2000jessy
    liz_lauren
    alyssa.kay

### Exercise 4:

Which are correct variable assignments?

* `a = 1 * 2`
* `2 = 1 + 1`
* `5 + 6 = y`
* `seven = 3 * 4`
