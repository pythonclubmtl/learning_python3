The first aim is to point out the ability of the mesoscopic phase-field method to make predictions of growth velocity at the nanoscopic length scale. Therefore the isothermal growth of a spherical crystalline cluster embedded in a melt is considered. We also show simulation techniques that enable to computationally bridge from the atomistic up to the mesoscopic scale. We use a PFM to simulate symmetric thermal dendrites started at an early stage of solidification related to nucleation.

The stress for a given representative strain, which depends on the geometry of the indenter, can be deduced using the reverse method established by Bucaille et al. [Acta Mater. 51 (2003) 1663] assuming that the normal force is proportional to the square of the penetration depth: F=Ch2. During the first stage of this work, nanoindentation experiments were conducted on annealed and cold-worked aluminium using the Berkovich and cube corner pyramids. The apparent hardness of these materials was found to decrease with increasing penetration depth. The evolution of the normal force as a function of penetration depth was therefore modelled by a polynomial equation allowing extrapolation of the mechanical behaviour to the macroscopic scale. Good agreement was found between the flow stress of cold-worked aluminium obtained in this manner and the values obtained from tensile testing. However, for the annealed aluminium, the present method largely overestimates the values. It is suggested that both geometrically necessary dislocations and the microstructure are the main factors responsible for the indentation size effect (ISE). Several scales must therefore be considered in order to extrapolate the behaviour of aluminium from the nano- to the macroscale. In the second stage of this work, nanoindentation tests were carried out in the aluminium matrix of the composite at small penetration depths to avoid any influence of the fibres. By comparison with previous results on bulk aluminium, the flow stress of the matrix was determined and its plastic behaviour was found to be close to that of cold-worked aluminium, in agreement with other studies. This implies that the aluminium matrix is strongly modified by the presence of fibres during the fabrication of the composite.","2004-03-25","2014-04-03 18:04:10","2014-04-03 18:04:10","2014-04-03 18:04:10","82-92","","1–2","369","","Materials Science and Engineering: A","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\D7NUCE8M\Bucaille et al. - 2004 - Determination of the matrix in situ flow stress of.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\DFPTNDC7\S0921509303013236.html","https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1jXoaQhrGctSEZKdEUwY3BrWFk/edit?usp=sharing","","Aluminium; Indentation size effect; Metal matrix composite; Nanoindentation; Strain hardening","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed method provides a simple means to combine traditional DIC approaches with peridynamics to achieve full-field displacements, even in the vicinity of cracks. In regions where DIC is accurate and effective, the displacement field is determined using a traditional approach. In discontinuous regions, the displacement field is solved for using peridynamics. This study shows that this method can be used successfully for investigating damage in materials such as nuclear graphite and fiber-RC (FRC). It also shows that the proposed method alleviates nonphysical strains in the vicinity of cracks, common to alternative approaches, which detrimentally degrade the quality of postprocessed quantities of interest such as fracture toughness.","2015","2015-07-25 19:48:18","2015-07-25 19:48:18","2015-04-16 16:05:52","04014115","","2","141","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASCE","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\NQBFE3TR\2015 - Peridynamics-Based Digital Image Correlation Algor.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\V9MUWZ2Z\(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This model enables predicting complex fracture phenomena such as spontaneous crack nucleation and crack branching, curving and arrest, a capability inherited from the bond-based peridynamic theory. An important feature of the model is that the bond properties, i.e. the stiffness constant and critical stretch, are continuous functions of bond orientation in the principal material axes. This facilitates fracture analysis of anisotropic materials with random orientations, such as polycrystalline microstructures. Elastic and fracture behaviour of the model has been verified through simulating uniaxial tension of a composite plate and fracture of a cortical bone compact tension specimen, and making quantitative comparisons to analytical and experimental data. To further demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model, dynamic fracture of a polycrystalline microstructure (alumina ceramic) has been simulated. The influence of the grain boundary and grain interior fracture energies on the interacting and competing fracture modes of polycrystalline materials, i.e. intergranular and transgranular fracture, has been studied.","2014-07-01","2015-01-27 17:27:58","2015-01-27 17:27:58","2015-01-27 17:27:58","431-452","","","276","","Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\JP36FADF\Ghajari et al. - 2014 - A peridynamic material model for the analysis of d.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\JCN3XE94\Ghajari et al. - 2014 - A peridynamic material model for the analysis of d.html; ","https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1jXoaQhrGctNS1vU2ZLd2plQTA/view?usp=sharing","","Anisotropy; Bone; Ceramic; Fracture; Peridynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this paper is to develop a micromechanical model, using the boundary element method, to generate information aiming to explain and support the mechanism of appearance and propagation of the damage. To this end, a single fiber surrounded by the matrix and with a partial debonding is studied. It has been found that under uniaxial loading transversal to the fibers direction the most significant phenomena appear for semidebonding angles in the interval between 60deg and 70deg. After this interval the growth of the crack along the interface is stable (energy release rate (ERR) decreasing) in pure Mode II, whereas it is plausibly unstable in mixed mode (dominated by Mode I for semidebondings smaller than 30deg) until it reaches the interval. At this interval the direction of maximum circumferential stress at the neighborhood of the crack tip is approximately normal to the applied load. If a crack corresponding to a debonding in this interval leaves the interface and penetrates into the matrix then: (a) the growth through the matrix is unstable in pure Mode I; (b) the value of the ERR reaches a maximum (in comparison with other debonding angles); and (c) the ERR is greater than that released if the crack continued growing along the interface. All this suggests that it is in this interval of semidebondings (60–70deg) that conditions are most appropriate for an interface crack to kink. Experiments developed by the authors show an excellent agreement between the predictions generated in this paper and the evolution of the damage in an actual composite.","2006-09-27","2014-01-31 19:51:58","2014-01-31 19:51:58","2014-01-31 19:51:58","703-716","","4","74","","J.

Experiments show that the first stage of fiber/matrix interface debonding is mode-I dominated fracture with very fast crack growth rate. Subsequent stable crack propagation along the interface is due to mixed mode I/II fracture. The aim of this study is to explore ways to stabilize the early stage of debonding so that it becomes possible to determine the mixed mode interfacial fracture properties for the entire mode-mixity range by in-situ observations. Therefore, the objective of this study is to stabilize crack initiation in the dominant mode-I fracture by changing the position of one fiber with its neighboring fiber or hole using the finite element analysis. The progressive fiber/matrix debonding is studied by focusing on the interaction of one fiber with its neighboring fiber or hole. The results show that decrease of the position angle stabilize the crack growth at the interface in the ligaments. This effect is more significant in the cases with small ligament thickness. In the two-fiber model and at very small ligaments the results show that the crack growth stops when the crack tips meet each other in the ligament and further crack growth is under dominant mode-II fracture. In the fiber-hole model, both the crack initiation and propagation are stabilized by decrease of the position angles at very thin ligaments. This paper suggests to use two fibers instead of a single fiber in order to ease the characterization of interfacial properties.","2015-01-15","2014-11-24 17:31:15","2014-11-24 17:31:15","2014-11-24 17:31:15","58-69","","","53","","International Journal of Solids and Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\34VKI8M2\Ashouri Vajari et al. - 2015 - Effect of fiber positioning on mixed-mode fracture.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\XXGJNE5S\Ashouri Vajari et al. - 2015 - Effect of fiber positioning on mixed-mode fracture.html","","","Composites; Finite element; Interfacial debonding; Micromechanics; Mode-mixity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fracture surfaces were observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and element distributions at the crack origins were measured by an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). The fatigue behavior can be divided into three categories:(a) The S–N curve displays a continuous decline and the internal cracks initiated from the large oxide inclusions for commercial 50CrV4 steel in which the average inclusion size is about 29 μm. (b) Step-wise S–N curves were observed for clean 54SiCrV6 and clean 50CrV4 steels in which the average inclusion sizes are about 3.0 and 2.4 μm respectively. Most fatigue failures originated from the VC inclusion clusters at the lower stress amplitudes.

S–N curve shows that the fatigue failure hardly occurs from 106 to 109 cycles, in other words, the fatigue reliability can be substantially improved in the super long fatigue life regime.","2007-04","2014-11-03 21:46:12","2014-11-03 21:46:12","2014-11-03 21:46:12","765-771","","4","29","","International Journal of Fatigue","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\3MEDQE6X\Zhang et al. - 2007 - Influence of inclusion size on fatigue behavior of.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\PBBE6Z9K\Zhang et al. - 2007 - Influence of inclusion size on fatigue behavior of.html","","","Gigacycle fatigue; High strength steel; Inclusion size; S–N curve","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One important issue in the implementation of DVC is the considerable computational costs associated with the huge amount of data, which hinders the applications of the technique, especially for high-resolution displacement and strain measurements. In this paper, we propose an accurate global DVC approach based on a Fourier decomposition for the kinematic basis of the sought displacement field. The approach, referred to as IS-DVC, leads to an algorithm whose computational complexity is not considerably increased by increasing the number of Degrees of Freedom (DOF) of the kinematic basis, thus being computationally efficient using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Artificial experiments have been used to evaluate the uncertainties of IS-DVC at high resolutions. Especially, displacement fields of 3D composites with spherical and non-aligned ellipsoidal particles at small scales were reconstructed. Resulting measurements revealed close similarities in terms of strain heterogeneities throughout the volume with the benchmark strains. Furthermore, it was shown that, in the presence of a discontinuity, the measurement uncertainties are not significantly affected, except for regions surrounding the discontinuity, hence validating the robustness of the reconstructed displacement field at a large number of DOF.","2014-04","2014-02-03 22:20:01","2014-02-03 22:20:01","2014-02-03 22:20:01","44-52","","","55","","Optics and Lasers in Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\SS4HSRE9\Mortazavi et al. - 2014 - High resolution measurement of internal full-field.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\ZIRXDTDW\S0143816613003059.html","https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1jXoaQhrGctS1NZYWhydDdmTlU/edit?usp=sharing","","Composite materials; Digital Volume Correlation (DVC); Global approach; High-resolution measurements; Spectral decomposition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The extreme value distribution of the non-metallic inclusions is used to predict the theoretical lower fatigue limit of the steel. The experimental part of the paper consists of the fatigue testing of 61 test bars that were taken from a process industry forged steel roll. The estimation and comparison of the fatigue limit and its deviation was done using the least squares and binomial analysis methods. The results from this analysis are compared with the theoretically predicted upper and lower fatigue limit.

In this paper, we develop an Improved Spectral Approach (ISA) to reconstruct continuous displacements based on their Fourier decomposition. This approach leads to a time and memory-efficient algorithm, thanks to the fast Fourier transform. Moreover, the Fourier-based decomposition enables accurate heterogeneous measurements. Improvements consist in increasing the accuracy and convergence rate as well as dealing with non-periodic displacements and images. Furthermore, a theoretical framework is presented to quantify the noise sensitivity of the ISA from which useful information is retrieved. The approach is evaluated using synthetic images deformed by heterogeneous displacement fields. Comparisons show that the introduced modifications lead to lower uncertainties by one order of magnitude in the case of non-periodic images and displacement field studied. Moreover, first-order (SO1) and second-order (SO2) subset-based Digital Image Correlation algorithms are compared with the ISA. The comparisons herein reveal that the uncertainties of the ISA are 6–9 times smaller than those of the SO1 due to insufficiency of the first-order shape function for the estimation of heterogeneous displacements, while being slightly smaller than those of the SO2. Moreover, as the image smoothness decreases, the uncertainties of the SO2 deviate from those of the ISA and the exact displacements. The presented approach shows great potentials for challenging applications such as strain measurements at microstructural levels.","2013-06-01","2014-06-13 19:52:46","2014-06-13 19:52:46","2014-06-13 19:52:46","233-248","","3","49","","Strain","","","","","","","","en","© 2013 Wiley Publishing Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\BD5SUF9H\Mortazavi et al. - 2013 - Image-based Continuous Displacement Measurements U.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\IUIUVAM9\abstract.html","","","continuous displacements; fast Fourier transform; inverse problem; noise sensitivity; Digital image correlation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, this work is focused on the tension dominated failure. After an abrupt onset the crack grows unstably up to achieving an arrest length. A simple plane strain model of a single circular inclusion surrounded by an unbounded matrix allows obtaining conclusions approximately valid for a dilute fibre packing. Linear isotropic elastic behaviour is assumed for both inclusion and matrix. Two classical elastic solutions for both perfectly bonded and partially debonded circular inclusions are used together with a coupled stress and energy criterion, proposed recently in the framework of finite fracture mechanics, and a phenomenological law for fracture toughness of interface cracks growing in fracture mixed mode. The obtained analytical and semi-analytical expressions make easy studying the influence of all the dimensionless parameters governing the fibre–matrix system behaviour: Dundurs elastic bimaterial constants αα and ββ, the interface brittleness number γγ and the load biaxiality parameter ηη. A size effect of the inclusion radius on the critical load is predicted, smaller inclusions being stronger and less dependent on the secondary load.

The mechanism of progressive failure was examined at both a global and a local level. A detailed analysis of the proposed micromechanics model revealed that it is able correctly to simulate the evolution of damage and to explain the softening mechanism.

It differs from the classical theory and most nonlocal theories in that it does not involve spatial derivatives of the displacement field. Instead, it is formulated in terms of integral equations, whose validity is not affected by the presence of discontinuities such as cracks.

This effect can be attributed e.g. to roughness of the fracture surface under dominating tangential crack face displacements. As the crack faces displace relatively to each other, the roughness asperities ride on top of each other and result in an opening (dilatation) in the normal direction. Furthermore, the interaction of the crack surfaces in the contact zone gives rise to compressive normal stresses and frictional shear stresses opposing the crack face displacements. A phenomenological Mixed Mode cohesive zone law, derived from a potential function, is developed to describe the above mentioned fracture behaviour under monotonic opening. The interface dilatation introduces two new lengths. The cohesive law is implemented in the commercial finite element program Abaqus.

The main objective is to link specific AE parameters to the fracture mechanisms that are successively dominating the failure of this laminated material. At relatively low load, fracture is initiated by matrix cracking while, at the moment of peak load and thereafter, the fiber pull-out stage is reached. Stress modeling of the material under bending reveals that initiation of shear phenomena can also be activated depending on the shape (curvature) of the plate specimens. Preliminary results show that AE waveform parameters like frequency and energy are changing during loading, following the shift of fracturing mechanisms. Additionally, the AE behavior of specimens with different curvature is very indicative of the stress mode confirming the results of modeling. Moreover, AE source location shows the extent of the fracture process zone and its development in relation to the load. It is seen that AE monitoring yields valuable real time information on the fracture of the material and at the same time supplies valuable feedback to the stress modeling.","2014-01-30","2015-03-05 17:59:44","2015-03-05 17:59:44","2015-03-05 17:59:44","e178020","","","2014","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.hindawi.com","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\FMDXA9UV\Blom et al. - 2014 - Application of Acoustic Emission on the Characteri.pdf; ; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\WSFG2WX8\178020.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605050","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The solution satisfies equilibrium and compatibility every place and satisfies most boundary conditions exactly. The only approximation is that the axial stress in the fiber at a fiber break is equal to zero in an averaged sense instead of exactly. Two important advantages of the analysis are that it can handle anisotropic fibers and it can include imperfect interfaces or interphases. Theoretical predictions of stress transfer were compared to experimental Raman spectroscopy results. The results agreed well and were used to measure interface properties. The strain energy was integrated to get total strain energy in a fiber/matrix fragment.

The interface is modelled on a nano(metre)-scale and the aim is to investigate its local influence on the ultimate macroscopic transverse properties. Fibre-to-matrix stress transfer (i.e. fibre-to-matrix surface interaction) is simulated by introducing elastic interface springs. Since these elastic springs represent the chemical (covalent) bonds formed at the interface as a result of oxidative chemical surface treatment, the micromechanical model can be directly related to the effects of this treatment. For the verification of the numerical analyses, the influence of the interface is determined experimentally by transverse testing of carbon fibre reinforced composites, using fibres that were subjected to different levels of surface treatment. A direct relation between the oxygen concentration on the surface of the fibres, the interfacial bond strength and the resulting transverse strength was found. The interface strength required to obtain perfect bonding was found to be dependent on the fibre volume fraction and at increased fibre volume fractions a higher level of adhesion is required.","1999-07","2014-02-19 19:04:20","2014-02-19 19:04:20","2014-02-19 19:04:20","917-932","","7","30","","Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing","Deformation, yield and fracture of unidirectional composites in transverse loading","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\5T8NFIHD\de Kok et Peijs - 1999 - Deformation, yield and fracture of unidirectional .pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\KGFFFNTB\S1359835X98001717.html","https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1jXoaQhrGctRU1YT3k0NDNRVUE/edit?usp=sharing","","A.

The method is based on the balance between numerical and homogenization error; while the first type of error states that elements should be refined in regions of high deformation gradients, the second implies that element size may not be smaller than a threshold determined by the size of the unit cell representing the material’s microstructure. In this context, we build a finite element framework in which unit cells can be embedded in continuum region through appropriate macro-micro boundary coupling conditions. By combining the idea of adaptive refinement with the embedded unit cell technique, the methodology ensures that appropriate descriptions of the material are used adequately, regardless of the severity of deformations. We will then show that our computational technique, in conjunction with the extended finite element method, is ideal to study the strong interactions between a crack and the microstructure of heterogeneous media. In particular, it enables an explicit description of microstructural features near the crack tip, while a computationally inexpensive coarse scale continuum description is used in the rest of the domain. The paper presents several examples of crack propagation in materials with random microstructures and discuss the potential of the multiscale technique in relating microstructural details to material strength and toughness.","2014-07","2014-04-14 19:23:31","2018-05-14 19:23:19","2014-04-14 19:23:31","","","","","","Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","false; false","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782514000905/pdfft?md5=31d63421b1ac7061284e36824ba7ed47&pid=1-s2.0-S0045782514000905-main.pdf; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782514000905","","Adaptivity; Concurrent Multiscale Method; Damage and Fracture; Heterogeneous Media; Strain Localization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The production of concrete and reinforced concrete structures creates lots of environmental issues associated with the significant release of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. In addition, the corrosion of steel reinforcement is one of the major challenges that current civil engineers are facing. In the United States, the upgrading of civil infrastructure due to steel corrosion has been estimated as several trillion dollars. Thus, it is urgent to promote sustainable concrete and structures to reduce their negative impact on the environment. The development of new environmentally friendly materials to replace steel rebar as reinforcement for concrete structure is a significant step to achieve sustainable concrete and structures. In this chapter, two types of sustainable concrete structures considering the use of natural fibres as reinforcement of concrete and concrete structures were introduced, i.e. Coir Fibre Reinforced Concrete (CFRC) mortar-free structures and Flax Fibre Reinforced Polymer tube encased Coir Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FFRP-CFRC) composite structures. The static and dynamic properties of these structures were studied. It was found that natural fibres in different configurations can be used to replace conventional steel rebar as reinforcement of concrete structures. In addition, both sustainable concrete structures show good potential to be used in earthquake-prone zones. The application of these sustainable concrete structures is beneficial for consuming less energy, releasing less greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and costing less to build and to maintain over time.","","2014-10-13 05:04:29","2014-10-13 05:05:57","","","","","","","","","OMICS group","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both models predict a strong nonlinear dependence of the critical load on the fiber size. A good agreement between the predictions provided by these models is found for large and medium fiber radii. However, different scaling laws for small fiber radii are noticed. A discussion of the asymptotic trends for very small and very large fiber radii is presented. Limitations of both models are also discussed. For very small fibers, it is shown that matrix plasticity can prevail over fiber–matrix debonding, leading to an upper bound for the critical load.

Liquid carboxyl-terminated acrylonitrile-butadiene (CTBN) and silicon (SI) rubber dispersions were used as tougheners for the EP. The morphology of the modified EP was characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The fracture toughness, Kc, of the compositions decreased with increasing deformation rate. Kc of the EP was slightly improved by CTBN addition and practically unaffected by incorporation of the SI dispersion when tests were performed at low cross-head speed, v. Both modifiers improved Kc at high v, and also the resistance to FCP, by shifting the curves to higher stress intensity factor ranges, ΔK, by comparison with the plain EP. It was established that both fracture and fatigue performance rely on the compliance, JR, at the rubbery plateau, and thus on the apparent molecular mass between crosslinks, Mc. The failure mechanisms were less dependent upon the loading mode (fracture, fatigue), but differed basically for the various modifiers. Rubber-induced cavitation and shear yielding of the EP were dominant for CTBN, whereas crack bifurcation and branching controlled the cracking in SI-modified EP.

To remedy this a general theory of the forces on singularities in a Hookean elastic continuum is developed. The singularity is taken to be any state of internal stress satisfying the equilibrium equations but not the compatibility conditions. The force on a singularity can be given as an integral over a surface enclosing it. The integral contains the elastic field quantities which would surround the singularity in an infinite medium, multiplied by the difference between these quantities and those actually present. The expression for the force is thus of essentially the same form whether the force is due to applied surface tractions, other singularities or the presence of the free surface of the body ('image force'). A region of inhomogeneity in the elastic constants modifies the stress field; if it is mobile one can define and calculate the force on it. The total force on the singularities and inhomogeneities inside a surface can be expressed in terms of the integral of a 'Maxwell tensor of elasticity' taken over the surface. Possible extensions to the dynamical case are discussed.","1951-11-06","2015-03-05 21:45:43","2015-03-05 21:45:43","2015-03-05 21:45:43","87-112","","877","244","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\BBHQP2ZA\Eshelby - 1951 - The Force on an Elastic Singularity.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\BBQKNW2B\87.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The composite behavior was also simulated through computational micromechanics, which was able to account for the effect of the constituent properties (fiber, matrix and interface) on the macroscopic shear response. The influence of matrix, fiber and interface properties on each region and on the overall composite behavior was assessed from the experimental results and the numerical simulations.

This paper investigates the use of acoustic emission (AE) to locate and classify the type of damage occurring in a composite, carbon fibre panel during buckling. The damage was first located using a bespoke location algorithm developed at Cardiff University, called delta-T mapping. Signals identified as coming from the regions of damage were then analysed using three AE classification techniques; Artificial Neural Network (ANN) analysis, Unsupervised Waveform Clustering (UWC) and corrected Measured Amplitude Ratio (MAR). A comparison of results yielded by these techniques shows a strong agreement regarding the nature of the damage present in the panel, with the signals assigned to two different damage mechanisms, believed to be delamination and matrix cracking. Ultrasonic C-scan images and a digital image correlation (DIC) analysis of the buckled panel were used as validation. MAR’s ability to reveal the orientation of recorded signals greatly assisted the identification of the delamination region, however, ANN and UWC have the ability to group signals into several different classes, which would prove useful in instances where several damage mechanisms were generated. Combining each technique’s individual merits in a multi-technique analysis dramatically improved the reliability of the AE investigation and it is thought that this cross-correlation between techniques will also be the key to developing a reliable SHM system.","2015-01","2014-11-06 18:47:51","2014-11-06 18:47:51","2014-11-06 18:47:51","424-430","","","68","","Composites Part B: Engineering","Damage classification in carbon fibre composites using acoustic emission","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\CQQUPRCI\McCrory et al. - 2015 - Damage classification in carbon fibre composites u.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\UDG3WI95\S1359836814003849.html","","","A.

The suggested modification involves the application of equal biaxial in-plane tension while the push-out testing is carried out. This allows the interface to be subjected to various combinations of mode I and II loading, ranging from pure opening to pure shear. Hence it should be possible to obtain data characterising the resistance to interfacial debonding and disengagement over all of this range.

As-fabricated graphite/epoxy laminates with specially designed grooved islands on their front surfaces were loaded on their rear sides by a 16 to 20 ns long laser-generated pressure pulse. This compressive stress pulse, generated in-line on the rear of one of the surface islands, propagates normal to the plane of the laminate and very quickly attains a steady-state profile of approximately 130 μm after undergoing multiple scattering from individual fibers and laminates. The returning tensile wave from the sample's free surface prises the composite island off by nucleating a subsurface crack. This crack on the local scale comprises several fiber/matrix interface debonds connected by the intervening matrix. The free-surface velocity causing this damage is recorded by interferometry and related to the far-field composite-scale tensile stress by using a one-dimensional elasto-dynamic analysis. The local fiber/matrix interface stress concentration corresponding to this overall tensile stress was determined next by using a finite-element simulation that idealized the fiber distribution within the epoxy matrix to be periodic. The interface tensile strength was taken as the sum of this stress and the compressive residual stress at the same location, which in turn, was estimated by yet another analysis based on the finite-element procedure. For a graphite/epoxy laminate fabricated from a unidirectional Hercules AS4 graphite fiber tapes pre-impregnated with 450 k cure Hercules 3502 thermosetting epoxy resin, an average fiber/matrix interface strength of 210 MPa was estimated.","1998-11","2014-11-11 17:25:50","2014-11-11 17:25:50","2014-11-11 17:25:50","1827-1837","","11","58","","Composites Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\DXWA7V43\Yu et Gupta - 1998 - Measurement of in situ fibermatrix interface stre.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\WWTIRPKM\S0266353898000487.html","","","Stress waves; fiber/matrix interface strength; graphite/epoxy composites; optical interferometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, it was suggested that an interfacial energy parameter might constitute a valid alternative. From an overview of the literature regarding the single-fiber composite fragmentation test, it appears that energy-based approaches have already been proposed in the past, but were either not successful, or not fully developed. Our recent energy balance scheme, proposed for the analysis of the initial interface debonding which occurs at fiber breaks during a fragmentation test, is presented and expanded here. The effects of thermal residual stress in the fiber, and of friction in the debonded area, are now incorporated in the energy balance model. We use a different shear-lag parameter proposed by Nayfeh, rather than the commonly used Cox parameter. New, extensive single-fiber fragmentation data regarding the interface crack initiation regime is presented, using sized and unsized E-glass fibers embedded in UV-curable or epoxy polymers. Some data for unsized carbon in epoxy is also presented. Fiber fragmentation is forced to take place entirely in the linear elastic region of the stress–strain curve, by means of pre-stressed single fibers. The importance of this procedure is discussed. Future work will focus on the interface crack propagation regime.","1999-12","2014-02-17 19:43:02","2014-02-17 19:43:02","2014-02-17 19:43:02","1387-1400","","12","30","","Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing","Fiber–matrix adhesion from the single-fiber composite test","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\SFN2NNFW\Zhou et al. - 1999 - Fibermatrix adhesion from the single-fiber compos.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\7I32PS8I\S1359835X99000433.html","","","B.

This model is used to perform numerical simulations of the stretching and dynamic tearing of membranes. A similar approach is applied to one-dimensional string like structures that undergrow stretching, bending, and failure.

The treatment is basically simple and uses earlier results of Rice [34]. Formulae are given in both the physical space and Fourier’s space.

Finite element computations performed for sinusoidal perturbations support the new formulae, rather than the older ones.

The effect of inertia is modeled using an explicit central difference scheme which is enhanced through the use of mass lumping, reduced integration with hourglass control, and numerical damping. The material nonlinearity and the flow stress dependency on strain rate, hardening and temperature are modeled with the Johnson–Cook visco-plastic model. The micro-void nucleation, growth and coalescence are modeled macroscopically with an isotropic damage model. The localization phenomenon due to the damage and thermal softening is suppressed by using the visco-plastic regularization in combination with the nonlocal visco-plastic model. The large deformation and large strain formulations are implemented within the X-FEM framework to model the macro crack discontinuities using an updated Lagrangian approach. Crack propagation and crack direction criteria are presented and the issues relating to the combination of X-FEM with the damage visco-plasticity model are addressed.

The classical theory has been demonstrated to provide a good approximation to the response of real materials down to small length scales, particularly in single crystals, provided these assumptions are met.

With this model we analyze the dynamic effects induced by different types of dynamic loading on the fracture and damage behavior of unidirectional fiber-reinforced composites. In contrast to the results expected from quasi-static loading, the simulations show that dynamic conditions can lead to co-existence of and transitions between fracture modes; matrix shattering can happen before a splitting crack propagates. We observe matrix–fiber splitting fracture, matrix cracking, and crack migration in the matrix, including crack branching in the matrix similar to what is observed in recent dynamic experiments. The new model works for arbitrary fiber orientation relative to a uniform discretization grid and also works with random discretizations. The peridynamic composite model captures significant differences in the crack propagation behavior when dynamic loadings of different intensities are applied. An interesting result is branching of a splitting crack into two matrix cracks in transversely loaded samples. These cracks branch as in an isotropic material but here they migrate over the “fiber bonds”, without breaking them. This behavior has been observed in recent experiments. The strong influence that elastic waves have on the matrix damage and crack propagation paths is discussed. No special criteria for splitting mode fracture (Mode II), crack curving, or crack arrest are needed, and yet we obtain all these modes of material failure as a direct result of the peridynamic simulations.","2012-04-01","2015-01-27 17:28:07","2015-01-27 17:28:07","2015-01-27 17:28:07","247-261","","","217–220","","Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\WQG56XFN\Hu et al. - 2012 - Peridynamic model for dynamic fracture in unidirec.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\3P6ETKKG\Hu et al. - 2012 - Peridynamic model for dynamic fracture in unidirec.html","","","Crack propagation; Damage; Dynamic fracture; Fiber-reinforced composites; Peridynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During testing, damage was detected using both visual observation under polarized light and acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. Separation of failure mechanisms, based on AE events, was performed using time domain parameters (amplitude and event width) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) frequency spectra of the AE waveforms. The latter can be considered as a fingerprint allowing to discriminate fibre failure, matrix cracking, fibre–matrix interface debonding, friction and ‘parasite noise’. Stresses in the specimens were evaluated using a two-dimensional finite element model (FEM) and monochromatic photoelasticity was used to verify the simulated stress distribution. Two failure mechanisms appeared to be in competition in the Broutman test: fibre failure under compressive stresses and fibre–matrix interface debonding under transverse tensile stresses. For systems in which the interfacial adhesion is not so ‘good’, like glass fibre–polyester systems for instance, fibre–matrix debonding was observed, and the progression of the debonding front with the interfacial transverse stress was recorded.

A representative unit cell (RUC) of a single NCF lamina with fibre crimp has been developed following this approach. The RUC has been used to predict the stiffness properties and to study the stresses/strains that develop along the length of the tows. To ensure the validity of the new modelling approach, the results obtained with its use have been compared with the results obtained from an equivalent RUC in which the FE mesh follows the actual curvature of the tows, in accordance with the classical modelling approach.

The aim of the present work is to apply the expression found to a geometrically nonlinear analysis of quasistatic, coplanar crack propagation in some heterogeneous medium. In a first step, we recall Leblond et al. (2012)’s formula, extending it to the case where the unperturbed stress intensity factor, for the straight configuration of the front, depends on the position of this front; in addition to being intrinsically interesting, such an extension is necessary in order to avoid meaningless divergent integrals in what follows. In a second step, assuming the local energy-release-rate to be equal everywhere on the crack front to its critical value, we derive an expression of the shape of this front accurate to second order in the fluctuations of toughness of the material. In a third step, as an application, we present a second-order calculation of the equilibrium shape of the crack front, when it penetrates a single infinitely elongated obstacle or a periodic distribution of such obstacles.

Simple and fast uniaxial experiments can characterize the material under such loading. However, the situation is much more complicated when complex stress states develop in the material. The setting up and realization of multiaxial experimental programs are complicated and the results not very reliable. Therefore, it is necessary to establish methods that can simulate the multiaxial fatigue behavior of composite laminates and estimate their fatigue life under complex stress states. This chapter focuses on the presentation of available macroscopic fatigue failure theories that take into account the synergistic effect of all stress tensor components on the strength and fatigue life of the examined material.

An addition of hexamethonium in a final concentration of 10(-5) g/ml resulted in a diminution of vagal effectivity in the range of lower and medium frequencies of stimulation, and was connected with a shift of the frequency-response characteristic to the right. At higher frequencies vagal effectivity was increased. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of hexamethonium the facilitating action is irreversible. By raising the concentration up to 4-10(-5) g/ml the vagal effects were reduced to a large extent, and the frequency dependence of the response was abolished at medium frequencies. In the range of 20 sec(-1) to 100 sec(-1) this dependence was re-established and may be considered as a part of a normal frequency-response relation extremely shifted to the right. The time courses of both types of effect are characterized by a steep rise and a decay of the response during the stimulation period. A mathematical handling of the frequency-response characteristics provides quantitative evidence for the extent of the hexamethonium blockade of vagal ganglion cells in the atria; furthermore it leads to the conception of these cells to act as a distributing system for a homogeneous innervation by a widespread divergency of postganglionic fibres.","1975","2014-08-21 17:47:18","2014-08-21 17:47:18","","1217-1225","","7","34","","Acta Biol.

The proportionality constants characterize the stiffness and the strength of the interphase. For a cell of the composite which contains a cluster of fibers, calculations have been carried out by the use of the boundary element method. Four cases have been considered: (1) perfect composite. (2) a single fiber in the composite with lower interphase stiffness, (3) a single fiber in the composite with interphase cracks and lower interphase stiffness, and (4) a missing fiber in the composite.

The model can be used at a small scale, where the particles in the grain structure are generated and aggregate, matrix and bond properties are assigned to the lattice elements. Simulations at this scale are useful for studying the influence of material composition. In addition the model seems a promising tool for simulating fracture in structures. In this case the microstructure of the material is not mimicked in detail but rather the lattice elements are given tensile strengths which are randomly chosen out of a certain distribution. Realistic crack patterns are found compared with experiments on laboratory-scale specimens. The present results indicate that fracture mechanisms are simulated realistically.

So beside the threshold value for crack propagation of long cracks inside a fish-eye, Kth, another threshold value can be found for the formation of the so called fine granular area which is characteristic for very high cycle fatigue failure. This threshold value, below which no initiation in form of a fine granular area can be observed, is further dependent on the chemical composition of the crack initiating inclusion. Thus, a true fatigue limit in the very high cycle fatigue regime depends on the inclusion size and inclusion type. Further the inclusion type with the lowest threshold value indicates an absolute threshold value for very high cycle fatigue crack initiation due to the formation of the fine granular area.","2014-07","2014-11-03 21:46:05","2014-11-03 21:46:05","2014-11-03 21:46:05","114-120","","","64","","International Journal of Fatigue","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\2F2TP82C\Spriestersbach et al. - 2014 - Influence of different non-metallic inclusion type.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\WI9VAPQ2\Spriestersbach et al. - 2014 - Influence of different non-metallic inclusion type.html","","","Bainitic steel; Fatigue crack initiation; Non-metallic inclusion; Threshold value; Very high cycle fatigue","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Part 1, the specimens contain two fiber coatings. Detailed experiments are conducted to study the fracture process by observation of surface cracking and through SEM micrographic analysis. Failure scenarios postulated through the ADM are consistent with the observed behavior using the measured constituent properties. Some of the features of the composites predicted in this work are: 1. (1) Numerous matrix microcracks, approximately normal to and bridging the fibers, are observed. For the present materials, matrix crack initiation precedes the onset of nonlinearity of the composite stress-strain curve. A semiempirical model derived earlier and a mechanistic crack growth model are used to study this behavior. 2. (2) Carbon mounds (or mountains), which are roughly triangular in cross-section and have a base width of approximately 5 μm, occur in the specimens. Their location displays a sensitive dependence on the properties of the glass matrix. The ADM suggests the origin of this phenomenon and the loading condition leading to it. 3. (3) A massive degree of debonding is observed within the interfacial region. Again, the nature of this debonding is quite sensitive to the properties of the glass matrix, among other things. The model results are consistent with debonding initiated by radial tension and having continued growth under shear stress. 4. (4) The progressive matrix cracking process is statistical in nature as the distance between successive microcracks varies considerably with position at their initiation. Calculation of the matrix stress field ahead of the interfacial debond leads to bounds, which surround the experimental observations, on the average spacing as a function of applied and residual stresses. 5. (5) Multiple fiber breaks suggest stress transfer has taken place in some regions such that high values of the redistributed fiber axial stress have developed. It is inferred that such failures can only take place in regions where the interface is continuous, while the model results are consistent with the observed failure stress in the fibers. We conclude with an evaluation of the quality of the model and the definition of future research and data needs required to further solidify our findings. We also offer some comments on the implications with regard to our understanding of the behavior of ceramic matrix composites. The well-controlled microgeometry of these composites and the overall consistency of their behavior with analytical models suggest that they can be regarded as truly pedigreed materials.","1998","2015-03-02 23:00:51","2015-03-02 23:00:51","2015-03-02 23:00:51","93-119","","2","29","","Composites Part B: Engineering","","High Temperature Composites and Interfaces: Analysis, Processing and Characterization","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\6WARC5JQ\S1359836897000024.html","","","A. ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs); B.

The fundamental aspects of optical correlation are presented, with emphasis on the applicability of the technique to the analysis of micrographs obtained during in situ deformation studies. Without considering specific algorithms, this paper discusses important practical issues such as accuracy and spatial resolution and how these are affected by image quality and other experimental difficulties. The technique was used to analyse image sequences obtained during in situ deformation tensile tests on two very different materials: antler bone and ferritic steel. As the technique does not require patterns or coatings to be applied on the surface of interest, the strain maps obtained could be used to relate strain heterogeneity to the underlying microstructure.","2005-04","2015-03-05 20:02:24","2015-03-05 20:02:24","","9-21","","Pt 1","218","","J Microsc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","NCBI PubMed","","PMID: 15817059","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15817059","","Animals; Antlers; Deer; In Vitro Techniques; Male; Microscopy; Optics and Photonics; Steel; Stress, Mechanical; Tensile Strength","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Around 21–30% improvement on the interfacial shear strength was obtained after addition of 2 up to 14 vol.% silica nanoparticles inside matrices. The improved matrix shear yield stress and interfacial bonding were believed to be the driving force. Moreover, the stress transfer mechanisms of the composites exhibited a dependence on the applied strain level. At lower strain level, the systems filled with silica performed similar behavior to neat epoxy matrix, in which nearly no enhancement on the interfacial shear stress was observed due to the pre-existed thermal compressive stress acting on fibers.

Modern criteria are expressed by quadric polynomials whose coefficients constitute convenient terms of the failure tensor of the material which for the isotropic body is defined by the respective failure stresses in simple tension and compression. Among the different expressions for the respective failure tensor polynomial of a material the paraboloid of revolution failure locus is the most convenient, since it fulfils the requirements of invariancy relative to any reference coordinate system, it is flexible and yields a unique solution for each loading path while it is unambiguously defined in the stress space. Furthermore, it is in conformity with basic physical laws and the extensive experience that the hydrostatic stress constitutes a safe loading path for the material. Experimental evidence with all varieties of isotropic materials corroborates the theory upon which the criterion is based. Finally, a failure criterion, based on void coalescence mechanisms inside the material, which also takes into consideration the influence of internal dilation of the material and therefore it depends on the hydrostatic component of stresses, is presented. This criterion is an improvement of the Gurson-McClintock criterion which permits a judicial determination of the coefficients of the respective quadric polynomial expressing it, since it belongs to the broad family of criteria based on energy principles.","1995-05","2015-03-19 20:03:41","2015-03-19 20:03:41","2015-03-19 20:03:41","239-264","","2","51","","Engineering Fracture Mechanics","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\QBGNHVQ4\001379449400270R.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A monomeric and a polymeric coupling agent showed significant and comparable improvements in interfacial shear strength (IFSS) compared to the untreated case under both tensile and compressive tests. Typical microfailure modes including cone-shaped fiber break, matrix cracking, and partial interlayer failure were observed under tension, whereas the diagonal slipped failure at both ends of the fractured fiber exhibited under compression. Adsorption and shear displacement mechanisms at the interface were described in terms of electrical attraction and primary and secondary bonding forces. For both the untreated and the treated cases AE distributions were separated well in tension, whereas AE distributions were rather closely overlapped in compression. It might be because of the difference in molecular failure energies and failure mechanisms between tension and compression. The maximum AE voltage for the waveform of either carbon or large-diameter basalt fiber breakages in tension exhibited much larger than that in compression. AE could provide more likely the quantitative information on the interfacial adhesion and microfailure.","2002-03-01","2015-03-19 20:32:47","2015-03-19 20:32:47","","231-245","","1","247","","J Colloid Interface Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","NCBI PubMed","","PMID: 16290460","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16290460","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model is developed within the frame of Finite Fracture Mechanics and it is capable of predicting the critical stress value for the onset of debonding and the length of the initial defect. A parametric analysis is carried out to understand the influence of the main geometric and interface parameters on the critical debonding stress, which is found to be strongly dependent on the fibre radius. Satisfactory agreement with experimental data from the literature suggests that this approach, suitably adapted, might also be applied in the case of a unidirectional composite lamina, representing a very useful tool for modelling composite material behaviour under multiaxial loading conditions.","","2014-02-11 19:12:26","2014-02-11 19:12:26","2014-02-11 19:12:26","","","","","","Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\EBXWVFTS\Carraro et Quaresimin - Modelling fibre-matrix debonding under biaxial loa.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\PE959UQV\S1359835X1400030X.html","https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1jXoaQhrGctTFlwQUwwUkt6Ync/edit?usp=sharing","","B.

Individual specimens were inspected using X-ray Computed Tomography and only the specimens with acceptable quality pin insertions were tested experimentally under a range of mode mixities. Two stacking sequences, uni-directional (UD) and quasi-isotropic (QI) were investigated. It was found that the pins inside the UD samples experienced significantly larger pin/matrix bond strength than those in the QI laminates. The resulting experimental data indicates that a non-UD laminate type may experience pin pull-out and thus increased energy absorption for a wider range of mode mixities than a UD laminate type. Energy plots show a clear transition from a pull-out to a pin rupture region for both laminate types. Specimens that experienced pin rupture during low mode mixity tests exhibited similar failure energies to those loaded in pure mode II.","","2014-02-11 19:12:37","2014-02-11 19:12:37","2014-02-11 19:12:37","","","","","","Composites Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\BQ2XTB7E\Yasaee et al. - Experimental characterisation of mixed mode tracti.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\93NWF2IS\S0266353814000372.html","","","A.

For the single-fiber pull-out test, a resin cone serving as the fiber entrance part, called the resin meniscus in this study, is modeled in finite-element analysis. This enables more precise calculation of interface stress around the interface failure point than calculations not considering the resin meniscus.

A theoretical model for the simultaneous prediction of the initial size of a crack originated at the inclusion/matrix interface (or equivalently the initial polar angle of this crack) and of the critical remote tension required to originate this crack is developed. Isotropic and linear elastic behaviour of both materials, with the inclusion being stiffer than the matrix, is assumed. The interface is considered to be strong (providing continuity of displacements and tractions across the interface surface) and brittle. The model developed is based on the classical analytic solutions for the above-mentioned inclusion problem without and with a crack situated at the inclusion/matrix interface and a recently introduced coupled stress and energy criterion of failure by Leguillon [Eur. J. Mech. A/Solids 21 (2002) 61–72]. A new dimensionless structural parameter γγ, depending on bimaterial and interface properties together with the inclusion radius a, which plays a key role in characterizing the interface crack onset, is introduced. Asymptotic behaviour of the predicted critical remote tension and the interface crack length/polar angle at the onset are characterized for small and large values of γγ and a. A size effect inherent to this problem is predicted and analysed. The following asymptotic characteristics of this size effect are noteworthy: (i) for small inclusion radii a, the polar angle of the crack at onset is constant (independent of a), whereas the critical remote tension increases with decreasing a, being inversely proportional to the square root of a; (ii) for large inclusion radii a, the length of the crack at onset and the critical remote tension are approximately constant.","2009-03-15","2014-02-17 21:10:55","2014-02-17 21:10:55","2014-02-17 21:10:55","1287-1304","","6","46","","International Journal of Solids and Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\TZACIDG3\Manti  - 2009 - Interface crack onset at a circular cylindrical in.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\HN5HGRVH\S0020768308004630.html","","","Brittleness number; Composites; Crack nucleation; Finite Fracture Mechanics; Fracture toughness; Inclusion debond; Interface crack; Scaling; Size effect; Strength","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This chapter presents the concepts and theoretical formulations used in order to model the fatigue behavior of fiber-reinforced composite materials, independent of their nature. The commonly used S–N curve types are presented and their applicability to the examined material system dataset is evaluated. Curves estimated by novel computational methods are also presented and compared to traditional ones. The concept of the constant life diagrams (CLDs) used for the quantification of the effect of the mean cyclic stress on the fatigue life of the examined materials is also described. The commonly used CLDs and those most recently introduced are methodically presented. Their performance is evaluated based on their ability to predict S–N curves under “unseen” loading conditions, covering all possible R-ratios of tension-tension, tension-compression and compression-compression fatigue. An alternative approach for the modeling of the fatigue behavior of composite materials under constant amplitude loading is also introduced in this chapter. This approach, according to which stiffness is conceived as the damage metric, whose degradation dominates the fatigue behavior of the material, is based on stiffness degradation measurements during the fatigue life of the examined material. When a certain stiffness limit is reached, the material is considered as having failed. Use of stiffness degradation as a measure for the modeling of the constant amplitude fatigue life of the examined material leads to the derivation of S–N curves corresponding to a predefined level of stiffness degradation and not to ultimate material failure.","2011-01-01","2014-11-12 16:26:50","2014-11-12 16:26:50","2014-11-12 16:26:50","87-139","","","","","","","Engineering Materials and Processes","","","","Springer London","","en","©2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited","","","","link.springer.com","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\GRMHW3GJ\Vassilopoulos et Keller - 2011 - Modeling the Fatigue Behavior of Fiber-Reinforced .pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\WKNTQR3Q\978-1-84996-181-3_4.html","","","Building Materials; Ceramics, Glass, Composites, Natural Methods; Continuum Mechanics and Mechanics of Materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the integral equations remain valid in the presence of discontinuities such as cracks, the method has the potential to model fracture and damage with great generality and without the complications of mathematical singularities that plague conventional continuum approaches. Although a discretized form of the peridynamic integral equations has been implemented in a meshless code called EMU, the objective of the present paper is to describe how the peridynamic model can also be implemented in a conventional finite element analysis (FEA) code using truss elements. Since FEA is arguably the most widely used tool for structural analysis, this implementation may hasten the verification of peridynamics and significantly broaden the range of problems that the practicing analyst might attempt. Also, the present work demonstrates that different subregions of a model can be solved with either the classical partial differential equations or the peridynamic equations in the same calculation thus combining the efficiency of FEA with the generality of peridynamics. Several example problems show the equivalency of the FEA and the meshless peridynamic approach as well as demonstrate the utility and robustness of the method for problems involving fracture, damage and penetration.","2007-11","2015-03-08 03:08:21","2015-03-27 23:54:17","2015-03-08 03:08:21","1169-1178","","15","43","","Finite Elements in Analysis and Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\TZXBTJET\S0168874X07001035.html","","","Damage; Element; Finite; Fracture; Penetration; Peridynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method is based on a classic specimen geometry; the end-notch flexure specimen. The experiments are evaluated using an inverse method. First, the variation of the energy release rate with respect to the shear deformation at the crack tip is measured during an experiment. Then the traction–deformation relation is derived using an inverse method. The theory is based on the path-independence of the J-integral and considers the effects of a flexible adhesive layer. Quasi-static experiments on three different specimen geometries are performed using a servo-hydraulic testing machine. The experiments give consistent results. This shows that the traction–deformation relation can be taken as independent of the dimensions of the adherends. Thus, the constitutive relation can be considered as a property of the adhesive layer. The deformation process at the crack tip is also monitored during the experiments by the use of a digital camera attached to a microscope.","2007-01-15","2014-02-05 21:20:22","2014-02-05 21:20:22","2014-02-05 21:20:22","530-545","","2","44","","International Journal of Solids and Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\KSEPKD55\Leffler et al. - 2007 - Shear behaviour of adhesive layers.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\IAFQ744W\S0020768306001466.html","https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1jXoaQhrGctQXhXRkpyeFBpNnc/edit?usp=sharing","","Adhesive layer; Cohesive law; Experimental method; Inverse method; J-Integral","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this, a suitable approach is the crack front perturbation method initiated by Rice (1985). It allows to update the stress intensity factors (SIFs) when the crack front of a planar crack is perturbed in its plane. This approach and its later extensions to more complex cases are recalled in this review. Applications concerning the deformation of the crack front when it propagates quasistatically in a homogeneous or heterogeneous media have been considered in brittle fracture, fatigue or subcritical propagation. The crack shapes corresponding to uniform SIF have been derived: cracks with straight or circular fronts, but also when bifurcations exist, with wavy front. For an initial straight crack, it has been shown that, in homogeneous media, in the quasistatic case, perturbations of all lengthscales progressively disappear unless disordered fracture properties yields Family and Vicsek (1985) roughness of the crack front. Extension of those perturbation approaches to more realistic geometries and to coalescence of cracks is also envisaged.","2011-02","2014-08-27 17:19:36","2014-08-27 17:19:36","2014-08-27 17:19:36","121-144","","2","59","","Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids","Perturbation approaches of a planar crack in linear elastic fracture mechanics","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\E8JJTPU5\Lazarus - 2011 - Perturbation approaches of a planar crack in linea.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\B8H4IEGX\S0022509610002462.html","","","Brittle fracture; Crack front deformations; Fatigue; LEFM; Perturbation approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The experimental characterization of composite systems under irregular loading patterns is another delicate matter, hindering the possibility of developing methods based solely on experimental results and therefore making theoretical modeling procedures indispensable.

This study is concerned with an improved Finite Element Model Updating (FEMU) for accurate identification of mechanical properties of composite materials components from full-field measured displacement data. This numerical–analytical approach, namely Regularized Model Updating (RMU), is developed based on a hybrid constrained optimization algorithm. For this purpose, mechanical constraints, consisting of an appropriate homogenization model, are added as regularization factors to the optimization algorithm. The proposed method is validated by conducting several virtual experiments through elastic constitutive parameters identification of 2D composites. The sensitivity of the developed algorithm to different levels of noises of measured displacement fields is investigated. The identification results indicate that the proposed RMU methodology leads to higher accuracy of mechanical properties in comparison with FEMU method, particularly in the presence of random noise.","2013-11","2014-02-03 22:20:05","2014-02-03 22:20:05","2014-02-03 22:20:05","116-125","","","105","","Composite Structures","A new approach to inverse identification of mechanical properties of composite materials","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\6EFFF9D4\Rahmani et al. - 2013 - A new approach to inverse identification of mechan.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\62RJBZSD\S0263822313001773.html","https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1jXoaQhrGctcVdkU3ZsdW5uM0E/edit?usp=sharing","","Full-field measurement; Homogenization model; Hybrid optimization; Inverse identification; Model updating; Regularization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sample mounting technique on a curved surface is presented that ensures contact between an unmodified fiber and substrate. The indentation analysis considers three separate corrections to the well-known Oliver and Pharr method: (i) overestimation of the projected contact area due to sample curvature, (ii) overestimation of projected contact area due to substrate curvature, and (iii) underestimation of fiber stiffness due to the structural compliance of the sample. The method is applied to four types of high performance ballistic fibers: KM2 Plus, Twaron, AuTx, and Dyneema; the results are presented according to both the modified analyses as well as the standard Oliver and Pharr analysis. The modified analyses resulted in an increase in the elastic modulus and hardness of up to 35 and 60%, respectively, compared to the Oliver–Pharr method. The technique has the potential to be applied to single microfilaments under various environmental conditions that may otherwise be compromised by traditional fiber mounting methods.","2014","2014-07-09 18:26:40","2014-07-09 18:26:40","","1104-1112","","09","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge Journals Online","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\N2N9CICB\displayAbstract.html","","","Nanoindentation; atomic force microscope; fiber mounting technique; microfiber; processing/structure/property relationship","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of residual axial strain in the fiber and fiber surface topography were included. The residual axial strain was found to be a significant parameter. It is shown that the interface failure can be progressive or catastrophic. In the case of a progressive failure of the interface, the load-displacement curve is nonlinear. The portion of the curve from above the first nonlinearity to near the peak load can be predicted in terms of parameters of the interface, viz., the friction coefficient, the radial stress at the interface, the fracture toughness of the interface, and the residual axial strain in the fiber. Values for these parameters can be obtained from a single loaddeflection curve. The peak load and load drop, which are usually reported, are found not to be directly relatable to any interface property, since the length of the last portion of the fiber to debond is influenced by end effects and hence not easily predicted. However, for data which describe the peak load as a function of initial embedded length, that factor can be eliminated and the data reduced to yield the relevant interface parameters. In pullout, the peak and friction loads saturate with large specimen thickness. Catastrophic failure is favored when the debond initiation load is high or when residual stress is low. Finally, a methodology to extract interface parameters from experimental data is suggested.","1991-07-01","2015-03-03 00:37:05","2015-03-03 00:37:05","2015-03-03 00:37:05","1585-1596","","7","74","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\H383XHQW\abstract;jsessionid=CB4A12A0F94F3DB132C698909BD28352.html","","","fibers; interfaces; pullout; pushout; toughness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early chapters focus on the underlying principles governing composite damage, reviewing basic equations and mechanics theory, before describing mechanisms of damage such as cracking, breakage and buckling. In subsequent chapters, the physical mechanisms underlying the formation and progression of damage under mechanical loads are described with ample experimental data, and micro- and macro-level damage models are combined. Finally, fatigue of composite materials is discussed using fatigue-life diagrams. While there is a special emphasis on polymer matrix composites, metal and ceramic matrix composites are also described.

Because of their heterogeneous nature and the very dissimilar expansion/contraction behaviour and mechanical properties of the two components thermal stresses are easily generated and can prove troublesome. The effects are exacerbated by thermal cycling, which can occur in a working environment. Furthermore, composites are usually employed at a temperature within ∼150°C of the glass transition temperature, Tg, of the matrix and in extreme conditions within ∼20°C or less of Tg. This tends to be a harsher thermal environment than is experienced by other materials and can lead to degradation of the composite and a reduction in properties. Both effects, thermal cycling and thermal degradation, are surveyed in this two-part paper with, mainly, reference to work reported during the last decade. For thermal cycling most work has involved carbon-fibres, principally with a modulus in the range 250–300 GPa and a CTE of −0.3–1×10−6 °C−1, along the fibre axis, compared with properties for the polyimide and epoxy matrices of ∼3 GPa and ∼50×10−6 °C−1, respectively. With a 100°C temperature change and a unidirectional laminate stresses of ±15 MPa can be generated, with somewhat higher values for a typical 0/90 laminate (the type most often studied experimentally). Under thermal cycling damage, mainly matrix cracking resulting in reduced flexural and transverse properties, was widely reported and the role of moisture and volatiles in reducing cracking, noted. Unfortunately the simple theoretical treatment developed some time ago was rarely used in assessing the results.","1998-06-01","2015-08-12 16:21:05","2015-08-12 16:21:05","2015-08-12 16:21:05","85-91","","3","19","","Materials & Design","Thermal effects on polymer matrix composites","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\9GIGB9U4\S0261306998000181.html","","","Epoxy; Carbon-fibre; Composite; Fibre; Polyimide; Resin; Thermal cycling; Thermal stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A methodology is proposed for predict ing the evolution of residual stress development during the curing process. A one- dimensional cure simulation analysis is coupled to an incremental laminated plate theory model to study the relationships between complex gradients in temperature and degree of cure, and process-induced residual stress and deformation. Material models are proposed to describe the mechanical properties, thermal and chemical strains of the thermoset resin during cure. These material models are incorporated into a micromechanics model to pre dict the effective mechanical properties and process-induced strains of the composite dur ing cure. Thermal expansion and cure shrinkage contribute to changes in material specific volume and represent important sources of internal loading included in the analysis. Tem perature and degree of cure gradients that develop during the curing process represent fun damental mechanisms that contribute to stress development not considered in traditional residual stress analyses of laminated composites. Model predictions of cure dependent epoxy modulus and curvature in unsymmetric graphite/epoxy laminates are correlated with experimental data. The effects of processing history (autoclave temperature cure cy cle), laminate thickness, resin cure shrinkage and laminate stacking sequence on the evo lution of process-induced stress and deformation in thick-section glass/polyester and graphite/epoxy laminates during cure are studied. The magnitude of process-induced residual stress is sufficient to mitiate transverse cracks and delammations. The results clearly indicate that the mechanics and performance of thick-section thermoset laminates are strongly dependent on processing history.","1992-01-05","2015-08-07 22:57:19","2015-08-07 22:57:19","2015-08-07 22:57:19","626-660","","5","26","","Journal of Composite Materials","","","","","","","","en","","","","","jcm.sagepub.com","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\SRK9FGWE\626.html; ","https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCcQFjABahUKEwj6udvciJjHAhXDGR4KHZieCTg&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dtic.mil%2Fcgi-bin%2FGetTRDoc%3FAD%3DADA231221&ei=mDfFVfqNL8OzeJi9psAD&usg=AFQjCNHt8DZqIW8sl5gbKmlRCCEE06UEjQ&sig2=0PWXXtcQge_wbjTceL4srA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peridynamic parameters such as micromodulus and critical stretch were established following the similar concepts in elasticity theory and mechanics of composite. In this peridynamic model three types of damages in composite laminate could be analyzed: fiber fracture, matrix fracture and delamination. The mesh independency was also examined for this approach. In the examples of laminate with unidirectional and multidirectional layup, the progressive damages and failure modes were successfully analyzed under a tensile load and had a good agreement with experiments.

The approach is based on a direct method which allows predicting the fatigue life from the stabilised damage state. The classical direct method is generalised to the case of coupled plasticity with damage mechanics of the UD-FRP composite materials [1]. The constitutive model is based on a continuous damage meso-scale approach [2]. By analysing damage variables and thermodynamical forces associated with damage at the stabilised state, fatigue life prediction law is proposed as a power law function of stabilised thermodynamic forces. The obtained numerical results have been validated by experimental test results on standard glass-fibre/epoxy angle-ply and cross-ply laminate plates.

Because it is based on concepts not commonly used in the past, the purpose of this book is to explain the peridynamic theory in a single framework. It presents not only the theoretical basis but also its numerical implementation. The book begins with an overview of the peridynamic theory and derivation of its governing equations. The relationship between peridynamics and classical continuum mechanics is established, and this leads to the ordinary state-based peridynamics formulations for both isotropic and composite materials. Numerical treatments of the peridynamic equations are presented in detail along with solutions to many benchmark and demonstration problems. In order to take advantage of salient features of peridynamics and the finite element method, a coupling technique is also described. Finally, an extension of the peridynamic theory for thermal diffusion and fully coupled thermomechanics is presented with applications.--","2014","2015-03-31 00:18:41","2015-03-31 00:18:41","","","289","","","","","","","","","","Springer","New York","","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","TA409 .M333 2014","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\4PQI3CK7\Peridynamic Theory and Its Applications.pdf","","","Fracture mechanics; Continuum mechanics; Fatigue Mathematical models; Materials; Mathematical models","","","","Oterkus, Erkan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cyclic thermal expansion measurements revealed process-induced residual thermal stress. By annealing the composite above the glass transition temperature of the Polyphenylene sulfide matrix, the residual thermal stress can be reduced. This is attributed to structural relaxation processes. The influence of residual thermal stress on the interfacial fracture toughness was investigated by push-out measurements. Using a cyclic loading schedule consisting of subsequent unloading–reloading cycles, the dissipative and non-dissipative energy contributions during push-out test can be evaluated separately. An adapted energy-based method allows the evaluation of the interfacial fracture toughness. Reducing the amount of residual thermal stress causes a change in failure behavior from brittle to quasi-ductile failure.

Fractography is the study of fracture surface morphologies and it gives an insight into damage and failure mechanisms, underpinning the development of physically-based failure criteria. In composites research it provides a crucial link between predictive models and experimental observations. Finally, it is vital for post-mortem analysis of failed or crashed polymer composite components, the findings of which can be used to optimise future designs.Failure analysis and fractography of polymer composites covers the following topics: methodology and tools for failure analysis; fibre-dominated failures; delamination-dominated failures; fatigue failures; the influence of fibre architecture on failure; types of defect and damage; case studies of failures due to overload and design deficiencies; case studies of failures due to material and manufacturing defects; and case studies of failures due to in-service factors.With its distinguished author, Failure analysis and fractography of polymer composites is a standard reference text for researchers working on damage and failure mechanisms in composites, engineers characterising manufacturing and in-service defects in composite structures, and investigators undertaking post-mortem failure analysis of components. The book is aimed at both academic and industrial users, specifically final year and postgraduate engineering and materials students researching composites and industry designers and engineers in aerospace, civil, marine, power and transport applications.Examines the study of fracture surface morphologies in uderstanding composite structural behaviourDiscusses composites research and post-modern analysis of failed or crashed polymer composite componentsProvides an overview of damage mechanisms, types of defect and failure criteria","2009-09-28","2015-05-28 20:19:23","2015-05-28 20:19:23","","","608","","","","","","","","","","Elsevier","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.ca/books?id=aMikAgAAQBAJ","","Technology & Engineering / Materials Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach presented here provides the ability to model the macroscopic dynamics while at the same time resolving the dynamics at the length scales of the microstructure. Central to the methodology is a novel two-scale evolution equation. The rescaled solution of this equation is shown to provide a strong approximation to the actual deformation inside the peridynamic material. The two scale evolution can be split into a microscopic component tracking the dynamics at the length scale of the heterogeneities and a macroscopic component tracking the volume averaged (homogenized) dynamics. The interplay between the microscopic and macroscopic dynamics is given by a coupled system of evolution equations. The equations show that the forces generated by the homogenized deformation inside the medium are related to the homogenized deformation through a history dependent constitutive relation.","2010-12-09","2015-06-09 17:13:01","2015-06-09 17:13:01","2015-06-09 17:13:01","71-103","","1","106","","J Elast","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\3X7KC97A\10.html","","","Dynamics; Elasticity; Heterogeneous materials; Mechanics; Peridynamics; 73; Automotive Engineering; Multiscale; Nonlocal forces","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

G. R. Irwin attended and graduated from Knox College and the University of Illinois where he won his Ph.D. degree. From 1936 till 1967, he worked in the US Naval Research Laboratory and in 1972, he became a Professor of Lehigh University and the University of Maryland where he now works. On the basis of his own experiments and the results of other researchers, G. R. Irwin suggested fundamentally new modification of the Griffith theory of brittle fracture and generalized this theory to the case of quasibrittle materials (see [2] and subsequent works). He introduced the concept of effective surface energy (1) and reformulated the Griffith theory in terms of singular stresses at the crack front and proved that his approach is equivalent to the Griffith energy approach [8]. He introduced stress intensity factors, i.e., parameters which relate the local mechanical state near the crack tip to macroscopic characteristics (such as the geometry of a body and loading) and enable one to give a very simple description of fracture processes as a continuous process of stable crack growth up to the onset of instability. His ideas very important for practical use and subsequent works devoted to their improvement and development caused a decisive influence on the progress in fracture mechanics as a new science and powerful engineering tool applicable to numerous problems connected with manufacturing and processing of materials and their failureproof operation in critical structures of various materials. By his works, Irwin initiated investigation of various aspects of the theory of fracture such as the role of plasticity, dynamics of the process, fractographic analysis of crack growth, etc. He also gave much attention to the development of new test methods for the determination of the characteristics of crackgrowth resistance of structural materials and their application. In recognition of Irwin's fundamental contribution to fracture mechanics, its fundamentals are now called the Griffith-Irwin theory (concept). A list of selected works by G. R. Irwin is given at the end of the present paper.","1996-09-01","2015-06-02 22:35:42","2015-06-02 22:35:42","2015-06-02 22:35:42","617-623","","5","31","","Mater Sci","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\KEXII2UU\10.html","","","Characterization and Evaluation Materials; Mechanics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Corresponding material properties such as mechanical and physics properties are evolving with the curing. This paper focuses on their determination by a finite element modelling approach of the thermal, chemical and mechanical couplings involved by the curing. The second part presents the constitutive model of an epoxy that was considered for the curing. The numerical solving, performed with a specific user subroutine of Abaqus® [Abaqus®/Standard User’s Manual Version 6.5, 2004, [1]], is detailed and allows the study of real three-dimensional structural parts.

An application is then proposed in the fourth part for properties prediction such as degree of cure, thermal and chemical strains, and shear modulus during the curing.

The objective of the VAMAS coalition is to promote world trade in high technology areas which includes the assessment and development of test methods for advanced materials. In 1998, Technical Work Area 5, Polymer Composites, established a program to measure the fiber-matrix interfacial behavior with an initial focus on the single fiber fragmentation test (SFFT). The National Institute of Standards and Technology 9NIST), in dialogue with Michigan State University, developed a set of protocols for conducting the single fiber fragmentation test which included coupon size, coupon fabrication, testing parameters, data analysis, etc. Seven laboratories participated in the round robin with each laboratory supplied with 10 coupons to be tested in compliance with the NIST protocols. The results of the round robin found that five of the laboratories produced data that were in close agreement while two of the participating laboratories had results that were 20% variant from the population mean. A review of the coupons returned by the two laboratories with the variant data showed that one laboratory incorrectly measured the critical length and the other laboratory incorrectly measured the fiber diameter. When corrected for these errors, the outlying data are shifted to be in statistical agreement with the population mean. The results of the round robin show that the fragmentation test generates a consistent measurement of the aspect ratio when the test is executed in accordance to test protocols.","2002-10-21","2015-06-01 20:42:54","2015-06-01 20:47:01","2015-06-01 20:42:54","10 pp.","","","","","","","","","","","","","EN-US","","","","","","","","","; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\F5M3KR35\manuscript-publication-search.html","http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=860441","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it can be rather challenging to predict failure using this method. The assumption of lamina homogeneity is questionable when predicting failure, though it is suitable for stress analysis. Matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination are inherent to the inhomogeneous nature of the composite, thus the assumption of material homogeneity taints the failure prediction. It is, therefore, essential that the inhomogeneous nature of the composites must be retained in the analysis in order to predict the correct failure modes. Hence, this study considers distinct properties of the fiber and matrix and their volume fractions and fiber orientations while modeling composite laminates. The peridynamic theory is employed to predict the damage in center-cracked laminates with different fiber orientations. The predictions from the peridynamic analysis agree with the experimental observations published in the literature.","2009-09","2015-06-09 19:00:46","2015-06-09 19:00:46","2015-04-20 21:45:24","141-151","","2","90","","Composite Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\IX9W4QRA\Kilic et al. - 2009 - Peridynamic theory for progressive damage predicti.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\V65I5SUK\S0263822309000488.html","","","Composites; Failure; Nonlocal; Peridynamic theory; Progressive","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This can lead to an inefficient design, because excess margins will exist for all properties except the one that determines the gauge. The design of a material can be made practical by creating a hybrid composite consisting of two or more types of fibers or resins, each embellishing a particular trait or function to the material. This paper investigates both high- and low-energy hail impact against a toughened-epoxy, intermediate-modulus, carbon-fiber composite using both experimental and analytical means. The effect of introducing ply-level hybridization by substituting up to 20% of the plies with glass-reinforced plies is considered. It is found that delamination can be reduced by this hybridization, but the benefits are dependent on the impact energy and the test conditions. A computational model based on the peridynamic theory of solid mechanics is used to understand the benefits and trade-offs in hybridization.","2011","2015-06-09 17:01:22","2015-06-09 17:02:28","2015-06-09 17:01:22","210-217","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASCE","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\2GFHI6G3\(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These experiments show that failure in tension occurs in several stages (similar to certain other brittle fiber composites): multiple matrix cracking, followed by fiber fracture and pullout. In flexural loading the failure process is more complex. Consequently, the flexural test cannot be used for measurement of tensile strength (although it can be used for measurement of the stress for matrix cracking). The application of conventional fracture mechanics to describe tensile failure is discussed.

Everything from toys to medical devices, and from automotive to sports and recreation products, are being manufactured using thermoset plastics. An increased understanding of thermoset plastics technology and processes has broadened their use exponentially over the last few years. In fact, the importance and contributions of unsaturated polyesters, urethanes, and epoxy thermosets have driven unprecedented sales and production figures that approach the definition of commodity materials. As a survey of the technology, the handbook provides the reader with the practical implications of crosslinking, as well as establishing relationships between time, temperature, and mass, often ignored in the general overviews allotted to thermoset plastics in other handbooks. The Handbook of Thermoset Plastics offers the most complete collection of general and technical details available for this important subject.","1999-12-31","2015-08-10 21:39:27","2015-08-10 21:39:27","","","606","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.ca/books?id=5Vr07pdsXGoC","","Technology & Engineering / Materials Science; Technology & Engineering / Textiles & Polymers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the analysis of thermal cycling experimental results, an equivalent cycle time (ECT) was developed by applying degradation-reaction kinetic theories to thermal-cycling conditions. Applying this methodology to the weight loss measurements of composite specimens, thermal cycling was found to exhibit a slower weight-loss degradation rate than isothermal conditions. This observation seemed to result from a retarded diffusion rate of oxygen through the viscoelastic relaxation of the epoxy matrix exposed to the thermal cycling conditions. In the later stage of thermal cycling, the through-thickness microcracks were induced at the exposed surfaces and then propagated into the core of the composite laminates. Subsequently, the degradation rate measured by the composite weight loss was accelerated with the thermal cycles seemingly because themicrocracks increased the effective degradation-reaction area and enhanced the diffusion rate of oxygen into the unreacted core.","2001-01-03","2015-08-10 19:59:17","2015-08-10 19:59:17","2015-08-10 19:59:17","433-454","","5","35","","Journal of Composite Materials","","","","","","","","en","","","","","jcm.sagepub.com","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\UI9XK4TR\433.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is attributed to structural relaxation processes. The influence of residual thermal stress on the interfacial fracture toughness was investigated by push-out measurements. Using a cyclic loading schedule consisting of subsequent unloading–reloading cycles, the dissipative and non-dissipative energy contributions during push-out test can be evaluated separately.

Special attention is paid to simultaneously conduct these two techniques while avoiding their respective influence.

All these techniques are non-destructive (without contact) and offer an interesting full-field investigation of the material response.

Thermo-mechanical analysis and tensile tests of the specimens were carried out to characterize the thermal and mechanical properties of MWCNTs/epoxy composites. Due to the negative thermal expansion and high modulus of MWCNTs, addition of MWCNTs resulted in a great reduction of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of epoxy. The MWCNTs also moderately increased the Young’s modulus of the epoxy. Then, the effects of adding MWCNTs on micro and macro-residual stresses in carbon fiber (CF)/epoxy laminated composites were investigated using the energy method and the classical lamination theory (CLT), respectively. The results indicated that the addition of low amounts of MWCNTs leads to a considerable reduction in thermal residual stress components in both micro and macro levels.","2014-01","2015-08-07 20:47:47","2015-08-07 20:47:47","2015-08-07 20:47:47","209-216","","","53","","Materials & Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\2E7UXM5V\Shokrieh et al. - 2014 - Reduction of thermal residual stresses of laminate.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\I9KKSDV3\S0261306913006274.html","","","Coefficient of thermal expansion; Multi-walled Carbon nanotubes; Polymer composites; Thermal residual stresses; Young’s modulus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Test results obtained by TMA-microbond testing showed excellent comparability with those obtained by normal microbond testing. The temperature dependence of IFSS of glass fibre–polypropylene was measured in the range from −40 °C up to 100 °C.

Each system has its own distinguishing features; however, in MMCs and IMCs the study is rendered more complex due to the evolving chemical species (both temporally and spatially), and the multi-axial state of residual stresses. Before MMCs or IMCs can be used in actual applications, the role of interfaces in not only the strengthening but also toughening mechanisms needs to be clearly understood. For evaluating the interfacial mechanical properties of interfaces, thin slice push-out test has emerged as the de-facto standard. Though, conceptually the testing procedure is simple, interpretation of the test results is not. It is essential to conduct very careful experiments, make precise meso- and macroscopic chemical/structural/mechanical observations and perform a thorough theoretical/numerical simulation before the test data can be used in a quantitative manner. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of the push-out test is presented based on the theoretical/numerical and experimental research work of the authors’ group during the past few years. In this work, thin slice push-out tests were conducted primarily on Titanium Matrix Composites at various test temperatures (room and elevated) with different processing conditions (temperature and time). Different composite systems with Titanium based matrices (Ti–6Al–4V, Timetal 21S, Ti–15Nb–3Al) uniaxially reinforced with Silicon Carbide fibers (SCS-6) were chosen for the study. Effect of the evolution of interfacial chemistry and architecture (in matrix, coating and reaction zone) on both shear strength τs and frictional strength τf were studied. A novel finite element analysis based on nonlinear finite element method was implemented, in which not only the initiation but propagation of interfacial cracks are simulated. In the analysis, both shear stress and fracture energy based criteria are used to model the initiation of (closed) cracks. Quantitative values of τs, τf, GI and GII are then extracted based on the experimental data and the numerical simulation. A critical review of stress and energy based interface-modeling approaches and their applicability to various boundary value problems are made.","2001-03","2015-08-12 22:22:59","2015-08-12 22:22:59","2015-08-12 22:22:59","575-584","","3–4","32","","Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing","Interfacial mechanics of push-out tests","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\MT98A5MF\Chandra et Ghonem - 2001 - Interfacial mechanics of push-out tests theory an.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\4TKA25A8\S1359835X00000518.html","","","C.

The increase of the shear modulus with the decrease of the temperature is more pronounced between −40 °C and −100 °C than between 20 °C and −40 °C. Complementary DMA (Dynamic Mechanical Analysis) tests are performed on the M21 epoxy resin to characterise the viscoelastic behaviour of the matrix which contributes to the viscoelastic behaviour of the laminate. DMA tests highlight a low temperature transition called β transition (−67 °C for the 1 Hz test) which is responsible of the larger increase of the storage modulus, for the epoxy matrix, between −40 °C and −100 °C.

Billets produced by vacuum-impregnating layers of two types of fiberglass cloth with an epoxy were core-drilled to produce cylindrical specimens. These were used to study expansion perpendicular and parallel to the fiberglass layers. This type of composite is used to separate the copper conductors that form a helical field coil in the Advanced Toroidal Facility, a plasma physics experiment operated by the Fusion Energy Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The coil is operated in a pulsed mode and expansion data were needed to assess cracking and joint stresses due to expansion of the copper-composite system. The dilatometer is held at a preselected temperature until steady state is indicated by stable length and temperature data. Before testing the composite specimens, a reliability check of the dilatometer was performed using a copper secondary standard. This indicated thermal expansion coefficient (α) values within ±2% of expected values from 20 to 200°C. The percentage expansion of the composite specimen perpendicular to the fiberglass layers exceeded 0.8% at 120°C, whereas that parallel to the fiberglass layers was about 0.16%. The expansion in the perpendicular direction was linear to about 70°C, with an α value of over 55×10−6 °C−1. Anomalous expansion behavior was noted above 70°C. The expansion in the direction parallel to the fiberglass layers corresponds to an α value of about 15×10−6 °C−1. The lower α values in the parallel direction are consistent with the restraining action of the fiberglass layers. The α values decreased with the specimen density and this is consistent with literature data on composite contraction from 20 to −195°C.","1988-03","2015-08-13 19:34:55","2015-08-13 19:34:55","2015-08-13 19:34:55","233-243","","2","9","","Int J Thermophys","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\N6IVRHRR\BF00504243.html","","","Composites; Epoxy; Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering; Mechanics; Condensed Matter; Physical Chemistry; anisotropic expansion; dilatometry; fiberglass; thermal expansion coefficient","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The measured data is used to generate material models which describe the mechanical behaviour as a function of conversion and temperature. The in-plane thermal expansion coefficient (α) of the composite material decreases above the glass transition temperature (Tg), which is compensated by a higher out of plane deformation above Tg. Comparison of α and chemical shrinkage measurements suggests that chemical bonds between the polymer matrix and the glass fibres are formed prior to shrinkage of the epoxy matrix, i.e., at an early processing stage. This suggests that production of composites with low residual stresses requires focus on reactivity between the matrix and the sizing rather than the matrix cure properties. As a consequence, residual stresses in the composite material are mainly a result of restricted cure shrinkage rather than mismatch between thermal expansion coefficients.","2013-12","2015-08-14 00:40:48","2015-08-14 00:40:48","2015-08-14 00:40:48","1350-1357","","8","32","","Polymer Testing","Thermo-mechanical characterisation of in-plane properties for CSM E-glass epoxy polymer composite materials – Part 1","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\M4FMZBIZ\Jakobsen et al. - 2013 - Thermo-mechanical characterisation of in-plane pro.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\E3MXN76W\S0142941813001682.html","","","Composite; Curing; Material models; Thermal analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focus was given into the relationships between the thermal and mechanical properties, and the material response under different loading and environmental conditions. The strength (72 MPa) and stiffness (13 GPa) of flax/PLA composites investigated indicate a very promising material to replace traditional choices in load bearing application. The PLA’s crystallinity was measured to approximately 27%. Annealing above 100 °C for an hour decreased that value to 30%, but analysis of tensile results of annealed specimens reveals a significant reduction of both the tensile strength and modulus. This reduction is associated with micro-cracking that occurred on the surface of PLA during the heating as well as deterioration of the flax properties due to drying. The study results show that strength and modulus increased with increasing strain rates, while elongation at break reduces respectively. A modulus of 22 GPa was recorded in 4.2 m/s crosshead velocity. Further, flax/PLA showed significantly higher modulus than flax/epoxy for the composites studied. Improvement of the interfacial bonding and the temperature characteristics, combined the thermoplastic nature of PLA, demonstrates that flax/PLA composites is ideal for use in structural automotive applications.","2015-02-05","2015-08-15 17:50:08","2015-08-15 17:50:08","2015-08-15 17:50:08","473-485","","","66, Part B","","Materials & Design","","Lightweight Materials and Structural Solutions for Transport Applications","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\JHKGWMCT\Nassiopoulos et Njuguna - 2015 - Thermo-mechanical performance of poly(lactic acid).pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\6NKEHXNW\S0261306914005834.html","","","Mechanical properties; Biocomposites; Mechanical testing; Polymer–matrix composites; Thermal analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A comparison of the matrix crack development throughout both types of tests has been undertaken: they have been found analogous, but with very far much faster kinetics under thermal cycling. Moreover, the fatigue test frequency has a significant influence on crack onset and development.

In practice, while preferring glass woven fabric layers in fabrication, to achieve the required design strength, the nominal size of the component was increased. This increased the total weight of the component. In the present work, glass laminate is strengthened and stiffened by interplying high modulus carbon fabric layers for attaining better specific properties. Two symmetrical four layered glass/carbon hybrid laminates and two dedicated four layered glass or carbon laminates were fabricated separately using the hand lay up and compression moulding techniques. The static mechanical properties like tensile strength, flexural strength and impact strength and dynamic mechanical properties such as storage modulus, loss modulus and loss factor of these laminates were experimentally evaluated as per ASTM standards and reported. The influence of stacking sequence of composite laminates on static and dynamic mechanical properties was discussed in detail. The modulus curves of dedicated and hybrid composite laminates in a Cole-Cole plot show an imperfect semi-circular curve indicating the heterogeneity of the laminates and relatively good fibre/matrix bonding. A conclusion as to the superiority of one of the hybrid constructions for structural applications could also be reached.","2014","2015-08-16 16:48:46","2015-08-16 16:48:46","2015-08-16 16:48:46","459-468","","","97","","Procedia Engineering","","""12th Global Congress on Manufacturing and Management"" GCMM - 2014","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\4X84ICHZ\Murugan et al. - 2014 - Investigation on Static and Dynamic Mechanical Pro.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\7A8ZVC45\S1877705814033372.html","","","Glass/Carbon fabric; dynamic mechanical analysis; hybrid epoxy composites; stacking sequence; static properties","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some of them were quasi-mimetically taken from metallic materials failure criteria and others were inspired by observation of the appearance of the failure of the composites. Prediction of the failure of the matrix (also called inter-fibre failure) has traditionally been assigned to a certain interaction (typically quadratic) between the components of the stress vector associated to the plane of failure. In this paper, a revision of these proposals is first of all carried out in order to examine in greater depth the implications of some of them. Then, a micromechanical study is conducted considering, based on failure observations, that the mechanism of failure starts with a crack running between the fibre and the matrix. The objective of this micromechanical analysis is to elucidate whether the assumption that the stress vector associated to a plane controls the failure of the plane is physically based. The numerical analysis is performed using the Boundary Element Method, allowing contact between the debonded surfaces of fibre and matrix. Different combinations of loads are applied (perpendicular and parallel to the plane of failure) to check their influence in the energy release rate, which is the fracture parameter evaluated. The results obtained prove numerically that stresses not associated to the macromechanical plane of failure play an important role in the micromechanism of failure of fibrous composites. This fact has been experimentally checked by means of the performance of a series of two dimensional loading tests.","2003-05","2015-08-20 20:26:53","2015-08-20 20:26:53","2015-08-20 20:26:53","1041-1052","","7","63","","Composites Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\AEFU64N2\S0266353803000174.html","","","B.

The model only slightly overestimated the composite failure strain, but predictions of fibre break density were too high, which can be mainly attributed to errors in the Weibull distribution. Both the number and percentage of interacting fibre break clusters were under-predicted by the model. This was attributed to an underestimation of stress concentrations in the model. While the experimental observations revealed mainly co-planar clusters, the model predicted mainly diffuse clusters. The experiments showed that the clusters did grow any further after their formation, while the model predicted a gradual development.

In this work, we have performed a comprehensive characterization of the solvent-cast printing process using polylactide (PLA) solutions by analyzing the flow behavior of the solutions, the solvent evaporation kinetics, and the effect of process-related parameters on the crystallization of the extruded filaments. Rotational rheometry at low to moderate shear rates showed a nearly Newtonian behavior of the PLA solutions, while capillary flow analysis based on process-related data indicated shear thinning at high shear rates. Solvent vaporization tests suggested that the internal diffusion of the solvent through the filaments controlled the solvent removal of the extrudates. Different kinds of three-dimensional (3D) structures including a layer-by-layer tower, nine-layer scaffold, and freeform spiral were fabricated, and a processing map was given to show the proper ranges of process-related parameters (i.e., polymer content, applied pressure, nozzle diameter, and robot velocity) for the different geometries. The results of differential scanning calorimetry revealed that slow solvent evaporation could increase the ability of PLA to complete its crystallization process during the filament drying stage. The method developed here offers a new perspective for manufacturing complex structures from polymer solutions and provides guidelines to optimize the various parameters for 3D geometry fabrication.","2014-02-04","2015-11-23 22:04:56","2015-11-23 22:04:56","2015-11-23 22:04:56","1142-1150","","4","30","","Langmuir","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\5QKI2ZF6\Guo et al. - 2014 - Properties of Polylactide Inks for Solvent-Cast Pr.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\GPAAP5NP\la4036425.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The system processed the polymers with extremely high precision using a fine nozzle. An evaluation of one of the piled-up layers of the extruded lines revealed lateral and depth resolutions of 40 µm and 45 µm, respectively. Micro-pipes, micro-bends and micro-coil springs were fabricated in less than 15 min by stacking up melted polymers from a nozzle. A batch process was adopted for the supply of the materials in order to eliminate the use of toxic solvents, one of the necessary evils with earlier fabrication techniques. Microstructures fabricated by our system and by a conventional method were tested in tensile strength tests to compare the mechanical strengths. The biocompatibility of a newly fabricated structure was tested by cultivating a cell line (PC12) in a small poly(lactic acid) (PLA) vessel with a transparent base, then comparing the morphology and growth with those of the same PC12 line cultivated by a standard vessel.","2008","2016-01-25 20:41:51","2016-01-25 20:41:51","2016-01-25 20:41:51","025035","","2","18","","J.

Due to harsh growth conditions, the CNT-grafted fibers often exhibit degraded tensile properties. In the current study we explore an alternative approach to deliver CNTs to the fiber surface by dispersing CNTs in the fiber sizing formulation. This route takes advantage of the developed techniques for CNT dispersion in resins and introduces no damage to the fibers. We focus on unidirectional glass fiber/epoxy macro-composites where CNTs are introduced in three ways: (1) in the fiber sizing, (2) in the matrix and (3) in the fiber sizing and matrix simultaneously. Interfacial shear strength (IFSS) is investigated using single-fiber push-out microindentation. The results of the test reveal an increase of IFSS in all three cases. The maximum gain (over 90%) is achieved in the composite where CNTs are introduced solely in the fiber sizing.","2010-09-15","2016-02-19 00:29:02","2016-02-19 00:29:02","2016-02-19 00:29:02","1346-1352","","9","70","","Composites Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","false; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\RKGXVXR8\Godara et al. - 2010 - Interfacial shear strength of a glass fiberepoxy .html","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266353810001399/pdfft?md5=6af3d9eac972430e2f547cec2b8b4f17&pid=1-s2.0-S0266353810001399-main.pdf","","A.

When rubbed or slid against a hard surface, PTFE exhibits a low coefficient of friction but a high rate of wear. These unique properties of the polymer have encouraged many mechanistic and physical examinations of the processes involved in the friction and wear of this polymer. A section of such work carried out over the past 30 years is reviewed here. When rubbed against a hard surface, the PTFE chain undergoes scission, creating active groups which chemically react with the counterface. This results in strong adhesion and a coherent transfer film. Further interaction between the bulk polymer and the transfer film gives rise to anisotropic deformation of the unit cell, which results in closeness of adjacent chains and easy shear between chains. Sliding brings about growth in as well as reorientation of crystallites situated in a very thin subsurface region of the bulk polymer. Such structural rearrangement facilitates the joining of adjacent aligned crystallites to form films and ribbons which emerge as debris.","1992-10-15","2016-05-11 20:46:59","2016-05-11 20:46:59","2016-05-11 20:46:59","193-211","","1","158","","Wear","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\G9DMSTZI\Biswas and Vijayan - 1992 - Friction and wear of PTFE — a review.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Model unidirectional carbon–carbon composites were prepared using the same type of fibre and different pitches as matrix precursors. These included both commercial pitches and synthesized in the laboratory ones. The chemical composition of the matrix precursor determined the type of microstructure developed in the composite, this microstructure seems to govern the fibre-matrix bonding and in turn controls the fracture behaviour of the composite. In general, a matrix texture of mosaic (small size) seems to yield a good fibre-matrix bonding, making the materials to have higher interlaminar shear strength but having at the same time brittle fracture behaviour. On the other hand, composites where larger textures were developed in the matrix seem to have a poorer fibre-matrix bonding. This made the composites to have lower strength, but it allowed debonding of fibre and matrix during fracture. As a result, these materials showed pseudo-plastic failure behaviour. Other examples of both types of fracture behaviour associated with the change in microstructure and fibre–matrix interface are discussed.","2003","2016-05-12 19:00:23","2016-05-12 19:00:23","2016-05-12 19:00:23","2857-2866","","15","23","","Journal of the European Ceramic Society","","Ceramic and Metal Interfaces","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\4BDB2T89\Blanco et al. - 2003 - Influence of fibre–matrix interface on the fractur.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\XIPHUUIM\S095522190300298X.html","","","Composites; Mechanical properties; interfaces; Carbon; Microstructure-final","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is shown that the four direct methods currently used for interface measurement have problems that make their results inconsistent between methods and inaccurate. The failure process has been monitored in glass/epoxy pull-out specimens with very short fibre free lengths, so that crack propagation is stable. This showed that, close to ultimate failure, a very small length of the interface was carrying nearly all the (very high) load. This apparently high interfacial shear strength can be explained on the basis of the recently documented lack of a shear failure mode for most polymers. All four interface tests are centro-symmetric, or nearly so. In this situation, a matrix that cannot fail in shear, must fail in tension. Yet tensile failure is strongly inhibited by the centro-symmetry. Hence shear failure is forced at the interface itself by a tensile-type process. This involves tensile pulling of the polymer over the high points on the fibre. (No surface is perfectly smooth.) The result is thus unduly influenced by the surface roughness of the fibre and the shrinkage pressure, neither of which are directly related to adhesion. Although great progress has been made with fracture analysis of interface failure, this cannot resolve the problem of the unrealistic centro-symmetry of the tests. It is, therefore, recommended instead that direct tests on composites be examined for relevance and usefulness. The most useful method may well be to measure the off-axis tensile strength of unidirectional composites. This has been shown to be more sensitive to interface properties than both the fragmentation test and the pull-out test. Single-fibre tests and fracture analyses of these tests should be used only for basic research into centro-symmetric failure modes.","1997","2016-05-16 16:07:48","2016-05-16 16:07:48","2016-05-16 16:07:48","965-974","","8","57","","Composites Science and Technology","","6th International Conference On Composite Interfaces","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\6I8RCGKJ\Piggott - 1997 - Why interface testing by single-fibre methods can .pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\B3Z9RU55\S0266353897000365.html","","","B.

There is ample experimental evidence that cracks in brittle, isotropic, homogeneous materials propagate such that pure mode I conditions are maintained at the crack tip. An unloaded crack subsequently subject to a combination of modes I and II will initiate growth by kinking in such a direction that the advancing tip is in mode I. The chapter also elaborates some of the basic results on the characterization of crack tip fields and on the specification of interface toughness. The competition between crack advance within the interface and kinking out of the interface depends on the relative toughness of the interface to that of the adjoining material. The interface stress intensity factors play precisely the same role as their counterparts in elastic fracture mechanics for homogeneous, isotropic solids. When an interface between a bimaterial system is actually a very thin layer of a third phase, the details of the cracking morphology in the thin interface layer can also play a role in determining the mixed mode toughness. The elasticity solutions for cracks in multilayers are also elaborated.","1991","2016-05-16 18:37:17","2016-05-16 18:37:17","2016-05-16 18:37:17","63-191","","","29","","","","","","","","Elsevier","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\35GMTAM7\S0065215608701649.html","","","","Wu, John W.

Based on the complex variable method of Muskhelishvili, closed-form solutions for the stresses and the displacements around the crack are obtained when general biaxial loads are applied at infinity. These solutions are then combined with A.A. Griffith's virtual work argument to give a criterion of crack extension, namely the de-bonding of the interface. The critical applied loads are expressed explicitly in terms of a function of the inclusion radius and the central angle subtended by the crack arc. In the case of simple tension the critical load is inversely proportional to the square-root of the inclusion radius. By analyzing the variation of the cleavage stress near the crack tip, the deviation of the crack into the matrix is discussed. The case of uniaxial tension is worked out in detail.","1974-10-01","2016-05-16 21:09:19","2016-05-16 21:09:19","2016-05-16 21:09:19","325-348","","5","22","","Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\TEBT3N7Z\0022509674900027.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The technique combines the measurement of local deformations during tests in a scanning electron microscope and numerical simulations, in which the measurements are used as boundary conditions. Deformations are measured by placing a grid of markers on the surface of a single fibre specimen. The displacements of these markers are measured during loading of the specimen. Numerical simulations show that the radial and tangential interface stresses increase towards the specimen surface, causing the initiation of debonding at the surface. This effect is supported by tests under an optical microscope. The INS is defined to be the maximum radial interface stress just before the initiation of debonding. The INS values are determined for carbon fibres with surface treatment levels varying from 0% to 100% commercial treatment level. The results show an increasing INS for increasing treatment level. Based on the presented results, it can be concluded that the presented technique can be used for the measurement of the interfacial normal stress.","1998","2016-05-25 18:36:34","2016-05-25 18:36:34","2016-05-25 18:36:34","1027-1034","","9–10","29","","Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\58QVDE8A\Meurs et al. - 1998 - Determination of the interfacial normal strength u.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\NXXXSX5U\S1359835X97001309.html","","","B.

Among the different structures fabricated by 3D printing methods, helical microstructures attracted the attention of the researchers due to their potential in different fields such as MEMS, lab-on-a-chip systems, microelectronics and telecommunications. Here we review different types of 3D printing methods capable of fabricating 3D freeform helical microstructures. The techniques including two more common microfabrication methods (i.e., focused ion beam chemical vapour deposition and microstereolithography) and also five methods based on computer-controlled robotic direct deposition of ink filament (i.e., fused deposition modeling, meniscus-confined electrodeposition, conformal printing on a rotating mandrel, UV-assisted and solvent-cast 3D printings) and their advantages and disadvantages regarding their utilization for the fabrication of helical microstructures are discussed. Focused ion beam chemical vapour deposition and microstereolithography techniques enable the fabrication of very precise shapes with a resolution down to ∼100 nm. However, these techniques may have material constraints (e.g., low viscosity) and/or may need special process conditions (e.g., vacuum chamber) and expensive equipment. The five other techniques based on robotic extrusion of materials through a nozzle are relatively cost-effective, however show lower resolution and less precise features. The popular fused deposition modeling method offers a wide variety of printable materials but the helical microstructures manufactured featured a less precise geometry compared to the other printing methods discussed in this review. The UV-assisted and the solvent-cast 3D printing methods both demonstrated high performance for the printing of 3D freeform structures such as the helix shape. However, the compatible materials used in these methods were limited to UV-curable polymers and polylactic acid (PLA), respectively. Meniscus-confined electrodeposition is a flexible, low cost technique that is capable of fabricating 3D structures both in nano- and microscales including freeform helical microstructures (down to few microns) under room conditions using metals. However, the metals suitable for this technique are limited to those that can be electrochemically deposited with the use of an electrolyte solution. The highest precision on the helix geometry was achieved using the conformal printing on a rotating mandrel. This method offers the lowest shape deformation after printing but requires more tools (e.g., mandrel, motor) and the printed structure must be separated from the mandrel. Helical microstructures made of multifunctional materials (e.g., carbon nanotube nanocomposites, metallic coated polymer template) were used in different technological applications such as strain/load sensors, cell separators and micro-antennas. These innovative 3D microsystems exploiting the unique helix shape demonstrated their potential for better performance and more compact microsystems.","2014-09-21","2016-07-27 17:46:00","2016-07-27 17:46:00","","10470-10485","","18","6","","Nanoscale","Three-dimensional printing of freeform helical microstructures","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25072812","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25072812","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The overall residual stress introduced from curing was determined by considering two contributions: volume shrinkage of matrix resin from the crosslink polymerization during isothermal curing and thermal contraction of both resin and fibre as a result of cooling from the curing temperature to room temperature. To examine the effect of residual stress on failure, a model based on the Maximum Principal Stress criterion and stiffness degradation technique was used for damage analysis of the unit cell subjected to mechanical loading after curing. Predicted damage initiation and evolution are clearly influenced by the inclusion of residual stress. Residual stress is always detrimental for transverse compressive loading and pure shear loading. For transverse tensile loading, residual stress is detrimental for relatively low resin strength and beneficial for relatively high resin strength. Failure envelopes were obtained for both biaxial normal loading and combined shear and normal loading and the results show that residual stress results in a shifting and contraction of the failure envelopes.","2006-09","2016-08-02 15:00:20","2016-08-02 15:00:20","2016-08-02 15:00:20","5449-5467","","18–19","43","","International Journal of Solids and Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\JRBE36DT\S0020768305005317.html","","","Finite element; Residual stress; Curing; Damage evolution; Failure envelopes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The novelty of this work is to compare three different simulation methods for the composite Carbon/PPS by suggesting a 2D programing simulation approach that would reduce the calculation time of the elastic behaviour of the yarn of woven composite material. To conduct the work an experimental analysis was planned to identify the micro geometric parameters of the composite and to collect all needed dimensions for building the numerical models. The simulation procedures are carried out through three different micro-scale methods and by applying two different finite element approaches: 3D periodic approach, 3D random approach and 2D random approach, the results show that the Young modulus presents a differentiation reach 12% and the Shear Modules G13 and G12 is roughly 11% and 29.39% for G23. The micro mechanical results are discussed according to the recent literature investigations. The numerical results from the proposed approaches are discussed, which show good agreement with reality of the material when using the random 3D approach and very good gain of time of simulation when using the 2D programing simulation approach. This approach reduces the calculation time about 50% compared with other methods.","2016-12-05","2017-02-20 22:29:31","2017-02-20 22:29:31","2017-02-20 22:29:31","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.omicsgroup.org","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\ZZUZH7EB\A et al. - 2016 - A Comparative Study of Three Different Microscale .pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\98JAAWRU\a-comparative-study-of-three-different-microscale-approaches-for-modelingwoven-composite-materi.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Working with such model composites has obvious advantages, such as the full control of experimental parameters, the possibility of introducing perturbative effects in a controlled way, and the possibility of verifying theoretical models in the range of low fiber content. Indeed, macroscopic composite materials contain various types of defects and perturbative effects, such as fiber misalignment or slack, fiber-poor regions, voids, etc., which bias any quantitative assessment of mechanical and physical properties, and preclude the accurate verification of theoretical schemes. One difficulty in working with microcomposite models, also recalled here, is the need for an appropriate “scaling-up” procedure to the level of macroscopic composites.","1991-08-01","2017-03-06 21:00:31","2017-03-06 21:00:31","2017-03-06 21:00:31","233-236","","4","12","","Polym Compos","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\WRM5WVG9\abstract.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, fiber-reinforced SiC/SiC tensile specimens were loaded in a scanning electron microscope at 800°C, and full-field deformation maps at the constituent length scale were generated using digital image correlation (DIC). A colloidal system containing mechanically milled titanium nanopowder, bicine, and water was developed for use as a DIC tracking pattern that is stable at 795°C. The resultant full-field strain maps provide a constituent level characterization of damage evolution from crack initiation through final fracture. An analysis of strain along fiber lengths indicated that fiber mean strain and standard deviation reached a minimum at fiber fracture. In addition, multiple matrix cracks in the process zone ahead of a notch/crack tip were apparent and could falsely appear as a continuous region of high strain in DIC fields. Relatively large displacement (strain) error was attributed to noise and bias at these small length scales and small strain values, and approaches for mitigating this error are discussed.","2015-06-01","2017-05-22 15:57:19","2017-05-22 15:57:19","2017-05-22 15:57:19","1898-1906","","6","98","","J.

To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry is commonly based on empirical or measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning. The Oxford Dictionaries Online defines the scientific method as ""a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses"". Experiments are a procedure designed to test hypotheses. Experiments are an important tool of the scientific method.  The method is a continuous process that begins with observations about the natural world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about why things are the way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The strongest tests of hypotheses come from carefully controlled experiments that gather empirical data. Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported, a general theory may be developed. Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, they are frequently the same from one to another. The process of the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions. A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis might be very specific, or it might be broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies. A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested. The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis. Experiments can take place anywhere from a college lab to CERN's Large Hadron Collider. There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles. Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always in the same order. Some philosophers and scientists have argued that there is no scientific method; they include physicist Lee Smolin and philosopher Paul Feyerabend (in his Against Method). Nola and Sankey remark that ""For some, the whole idea of a theory of scientific method is yester-year's debate"".","2017-11-26","2017-12-04 19:39:57","2017-12-04 19:39:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 812148396","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\FZUASZ8Z\index.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The experimental results of the present work and from others published in the literature were used to assess the accuracy of the major codes provisions (Eurocode 2, ACI 318 and the BS8110 code) for the crack width predictions. The comparison between the classical measurement techniques and the DIC technique suggests that both of them are suitable for the analysis of the strain components (deformations) of structural members. The most important additional benefit of the DIC technique is that it allows the easy detection of the first crack with a high precision, measures the crack opening and follows the progressive cracking process until failure of reinforced concrete members. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the addition of steel fibers increases the load at first crack and amplifies the number of cracks which leads to a remarkable decrease in both the crack spacing and crack width as well as an improvement of the ductility. The flexural failure of the beam specimens also changes from a brittle concrete crushing at the compression zone to a ductile and smooth concrete compression failure. Moreover, the present study shows that, at service load, the code’s provision on crack width are conservative for beams containing steel fibers since predicting excessively higher values than the experimental ones; the overestimation exceeded 300% in some cases and none of the present major design codes takes into consideration the positive restraining effect of the fibers on the crack widening. The Rilem technical document appears to be the only one which takes account the positive effect of steel fibers on cracking, though still not accurate enough in predicting the crack width of fiber reinforced concrete. Based on the present experimental work and on data from the literature, a modification of the Rilem mathematical model is proposed with the aim of improving the crack width prediction of this challenging concrete material.","2016-03-01","2018-01-08 16:35:53","2018-01-08 16:35:53","","678-692","","Supplement C","106","","Construction and Building Materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\NRM7Q3BK\Hamrat et al. - 2016 - Flexural cracking behavior of normal strength, hig.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\V28GIKNW\S0950061815308369.html","","","toughness; Digital image correlation; High strength concrete; Fiber reinforced concrete; Crack width; Serviceability; Ductility; Brittleness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of particular interest, is the bending actuation of polymers, such as polyurethanes, by embedding opposing SMA wires. Previous investigations on these structures have focused primarily on embedding single or opposing SMA wires that have been trained to exhibit the two-way shape memory effect (SME) because of the simplicity with which the actuation behavior can be modeled and predicted. Alternatively, many potential adaptive structure applications can employ SMA wires exhibiting a one-way SME to eliminate the need for a priori two-way training of the SMA wires, and to increase the recoverable deformation in the structure. In this investigation, the repeatable bending actuation of polyurethanes using opposing one-way SMA wires exhibiting large deformation recovery is characterized with a full-field deformation measurement technique known as digital image correlation. These results are analyzed with a one-dimensional actuation model previously proposed for predicting the bending actuation of elastomeric rods embedded with opposing two-way SMA wires. Using appropriate recovery strains and constitutive bending responses, this model was modified to characterize an `equivalent two-way SME' recovery strain for the one-way SMA wires. A kinematic model of the bending actuation is also presented that attributes the origin of the equivalent two-way SME to the biasing forces acting on the SMA wires. Repeatable bending actuation was achieved in polyurethanes using one-way SMA wires prestrained 5% at an equivalent two-way SME recovery strain level of nearly 5%. These results indicate that repeatable bending actuation can be achieved in polyurethanes by using opposing SMA wires exhibiting the one-way SME instead of the two-way SME at a level 25% greater than reported for the two-way SME. The level of bending actuation will depend on the constraint of the SMA wires imposed by the stiffness of the polyurethane matrix. The symmetry of the bending actuation is affected by the symmetry of the local volume fraction of SMA wires and the symmetry of the prestrain levels in the wires. Furthermore, symmetric prestrain will enhance the level of equivalent two-way SME exhibited by the wires.","2002","2018-01-24 21:53:05","2018-01-24 21:53:05","","509","","4","11","","Smart Mater.

The following analytical models developed to measure these parameters as well as to determine the interfacial frictional stress are considered in detail: (1) the use of the debond or “kink” force from the force–displacement curves; (2) two-parameter fit of experimentally measured maximum pull-out force as a function of embedded length; and (3) models assuming two-stage debonding with imperfect interface at the second stage.

Since the manual approach completely depends on the specialist’s knowledge and experience, it lacks objectivity in the quantitative analysis. So, automatic image-based crack detection is proposed as a replacement. Literature presents different techniques to automatically identify the crack and its depth using image processing techniques. In this research, a detailed survey is conducted to identify the research challenges and the achievements till in this field. Accordingly, 50 research papers are taken related to crack detection, and those research papers are reviewed. Based on the review, analysis is provided based on the image processing techniques, objectives, accuracy level, error level, and the image data sets.

The results obtained from the Integral Contour/Cohesive zone model are compared with those obtained previously and the results show a good agreement with the reference one obtained (J-integral and VCCT method). These analyses are studied according to several parameters such as: the debonding angles, the fiber volume fraction which is studied by varying distance between the broken fiber and the neighboring fibers, comparing two different representative volume elementary (RVE) (square and hexagonal motives). This study goes into the context and allows the analysis of the fiber/matrix interfacial crack behavior in a fiber micro-composite.

The study is known within the composites community as the “World-Wide Failure Exercise” (WWFE) and in some circles, the “Failure Olympics”. The origin of the WWFE can be traced to an “experts meeting” held at St Albans (UK) in 1991, on the subject of “Failure of Polymeric Composites and Structures: Mechanisms and Criteria for the Prediction of Performance”. The chapter includes a comprehensive description of the process by which the failure theories are selected, a brief description of the failure theories, the data and instructions supplied to the contributors, and the chronology of the key milestones. It evaluates the current level of maturity of theories for predicting the failure response of fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) laminates, minimizing the knowledge gap between theoreticians and design practitioners in this field, and stimulating the composites community into providing design engineers with more robust and accurate failure prediction methods and the confidence to use them.

It contains an objective assessment of the performance of 12 leading failure criteria for predicting the response of fibre-reinforced polymer composites when subjected to 3D states of stress. Twelve challenging test problems (Test Cases) were defined by the organisers of WWFE-II, encompassing a range of materials (polymer, glass/epoxy, carbon/epoxy), lay-ups (unidirectional, angle ply, cross ply and quasi-isotropic laminates) and various 3D stress states (various triaxial strength envelopes, through-thickness and shear loading, and stress–strain curves). A systematic comparison has then been conducted between ‘blind’ predictions (i.e. without access to the experimental results beforehand) made for each Test Case by the originators of each theory and previously obtained experimental results for each Test Case. In-depth quantitative and qualitative ranking procedures have been employed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each theory, and the overall effectiveness of each theory as a potential design tool. The theories are grouped according to their degree of maturity and ability to predict accurately the 3D behaviour of composites. The results from this study provide unique information to the community, the intent being that it will form a guide for the selection of the most appropriate failure theory for use in a given design situation., This article draws to a conclusion the results from the co-ordinated study known as the Second World-Wide Failure Exercise (WWFE-II). It contains an objective assessment of the performance of 12 leading failure criteria for predicting the response of fibre-reinforced polymer composites when subjected to 3D states of stress. Twelve challenging test problems (Test Cases) were defined by the organisers of WWFE-II, encompassing a range of materials (polymer, glass/epoxy, carbon/epoxy), lay-ups (unidirectional, angle ply, cross ply and quasi-isotropic laminates) and various 3D stress states (various triaxial strength envelopes, through-thickness and shear loading, and stress–strain curves). A systematic comparison has then been conducted between ‘blind’ predictions (i.e. without access to the experimental results beforehand) made for each Test Case by the originators of each theory and previously obtained experimental results for each Test Case. In-depth quantitative and qualitative ranking procedures have been employed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each theory, and the overall effectiveness of each theory as a potential design tool. The theories are grouped according to their degree of maturity and ability to predict accurately the 3D behaviour of composites. The results from this study provide unique information to the community, the intent being that it will form a guide for the selection of the most appropriate failure theory for use in a given design situation.","2013-03-01","2018-07-05 23:45:09","2018-07-05 23:45:09","","925-966","","6-7","47","","Journal of Composite Materials","Maturity of 3D failure criteria for fibre-reinforced composites","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\SP2ZD4WK\Kaddour et Hinton - 2013 - Maturity of 3D failure criteria for fibre-reinforc.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus of the study is the effect of the proximity of the neighboring fibers on the ERR. For this, a hexagonal pattern of fibers in the composite cross-section is considered. Assuming one fiber to be debonded at certain initial debond arc-length, the effect of the closeness of the surrounding six fibers on the ERR of the crack is studied with the inter-fiber distance as a parameter. Using an embedded cell consisting of discrete fibers in a matrix surrounded by the homogenized composite, a finite element model and the virtual crack closure technique are used to calculate the ERR. Results show that the presence of the local fiber cluster accelerates the crack growth up to a certain initial crack angle, beyond which the opposite effect occurs. It is also found that the residual stress due to thermal cooldown reduces the ERR. However, the thermal cooldown is found to enhance the debond growth in plies within a cross-ply laminate.","2018-06-01","2018-07-07 20:32:02","2018-07-07 20:32:02","","463-471","","","109","","Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\M67W2IS7\Zhuang et al. - 2018 - Effects of inter-fiber spacing on fiber-matrix deb.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\9BG7KJGS\S1359835X18301337.html","","","A.

High levels of cure shrinkage were measured in the IFSS microdroplets which resulted in internal stresses causing significant levels of droplet deformation. The results presented here can be interpreted as providing further support for the hypothesis that a significant fraction of the interfacial stress transfer capability in epoxy composites can be attributed to a combination of residual radial compressive stress and static friction at the fibre-matrix interface.","2016","2018-07-07 21:56:09","2018-07-07 21:56:09","","012048","","1","139","","IOP Conf.

These advanced materials have become the focus of systematic and extensive research in recent times. The book consists of two parts. The first part reviews solids with microdefects such as cavities, cracks, and inclusions, as well as elastic composites. To render the book self-contained, the second part focuses on the fundamentals of continuum mechanics, particularly linear elasticity which forms the basis for the development of small deformation micromechanics. In Part 1, a fundamental and general framework for quantitative, rigorous analysis of the overall response and failure modes of microstructurally heterogeneous solids is systematically developed. These expressions apply to broad classes of materials with inhomogeneities and defects. While for the most part, the general framework is set within linear elasticity, the results directly translate to heterogeneous solids with rate-dependent or rate-independent inelastic constituents. This application is specifically referred to in various chapters. The general exact correlations obtained between the overall properties and the microstructure are then used together with simple models, to develop techniques for direct quantitative evaluation of the overall response which is generally described in terms of instantaneous overall moduli or compliance. The correlations among the corresponding results for a variety of problems are examined in great detail. The bounds as well as the specific results, include new observations and original developments, as well as an in-depth account of the state of the art. Part 2 focuses on Elasticity. The section on variational methods includes some new elements which should prove useful for application to advanced modeling, as well as solutions of composites and related heterogeneous bodies. A brief modern version of elements in vector and tensor algebra is provided which is particularly tailored to provide a background for the rest of this book. The data contained in this volume as Part 1 includes new results on many basic issues in micromechanics, which will be helpful to graduate students and researchers involved with rigorous physically-based modeling of overall properties of heterogeneous solids.  xx, 687 p. : ill. ; 24 cm.

A concept of subset entropy is introduced in this work to quantify the subset image pattern quality for DIC analysis and its effectiveness was demonstrated by experimental studies. By employing white-light images with almost uniform subset entropy and first-order displacement functions, the effect of subset size on DIC analysis was investigated for the deformation cases of translation, uniform deformation, and simulated quadratic deformation, respectively. The results show that the chosen subset size must be large enough for precise displacement measurements when subset displacement functions match underlying actual deformation. On the other hand, optimal subset size in DIC for nonhomgeneous deformation measurements appears as a result of a tradeoff between the influence of random errors and systematic errors.","2007-09-01","2018-07-10 15:48:41","2018-07-10 15:48:41","","967-974","","9","45","","Optics and Lasers in Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\EEDDSUF9\Yaofeng et Pang - 2007 - Study of optimal subset size in digital image corr.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\XKNTW2Z8\S0143816607000425.html","","","Digital image correlation; Subset size; Subset entropy; Displacement functions; Deformation measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effective elastic moduli of the material are thus derived. In particular, the method of asymptotic homogenization is used where a finite number of fibres are randomly distributed within the representative periodic cell. The study focuses on the efficacy of such an approach in representing a macroscopically random (hence transversely isotropic) material. Of particular importance is the sensitivity of the method to cell shape, and how this choice affects the resulting (configurationally averaged) elastic moduli. The averaging method is shown to yield results that lie within the Hashin–Shtrikman variational bounds for fibre-reinforced media and compares well with the multiple scattering and (classical) self-consistent approximations with a deviation from the latter in the larger volume fraction cases. Results also compare favourably with well-known experimental data from the literature.","2012-06-15","2018-07-14 17:18:47","2018-07-14 17:18:47","","1421-1433","","13","49","","International Journal of Solids and Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\J2ZEWJ2J\Willoughby et al. - 2012 - Homogenization methods to approximate the effectiv.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\PFNGTQ2J\S0020768312000509.html","","","Anisotropy; Asymptotic homogenization; Fibre-reinforced composites; Microstructure; Representative volume element; Effective properties","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The new module dune-composites, implemented within DUNE by the authors, provides a tool to efficiently solve large-scale problems using novel iterative solvers. The key innovation is a preconditioner that guarantees a constant number of iterations regardless of the problem size. Its robustness has been shown rigorously in Spillane et al. (2014) for isotropic problems. For anisotropic problems in composites it is verified numerically for the first time in this paper. The parallel implementation in DUNE scales almost optimally over thousands of cores. To demonstrate this, we present an original numerical study, varying the shape of a localised wrinkle and the effect this has on the strength of a curved laminate. This requires a high-fidelity mesh containing at least four layers of quadratic elements across each ply and interface layer, underlining the need for dune-composites, which can achieve run times of just over 2 min on 2048 cores for realistic composites problems with 173 million degrees of freedom.","2018-01-15","2018-07-14 21:41:07","2018-07-14 21:41:07","","269-278","","","184","","Composite Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\3RFRPPUG\Reinarz et al. - 2018 - Dune-composites – A new framework for high-perform.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\CRAHAIUF\S0263822317321797.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In spite of the large angle difference, it is shown that the topography can be accurately determined using regularized global Digital Image Correlation. The surface topography is compared to another estimate issued from a 3D FIB-SEM procedure where the sample surface is first covered by a Pt layer, and its initial topography is progressively revealed from successive FIB-milling. These two methods are successfully compared on a 6% strained steel specimen in an in situ mechanical test. This analysis is supplemented by a third approach estimating the change of topography from crystal rotations as measured from successive EBSD images. This last technique ignores plastic deformation, and thus only holds in an elastic regime. For the studied example, despite the large plastic flow, it is shown that crystal rotation already accounts for a significant part of the deformation-induced topography.","2018-08-01","2018-07-24 16:12:24","2018-07-24 16:12:24","","18-33","","","191","","Ultramicroscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\B856UH27\Shi et al. - 2018 - Measuring topographies from conventional SEM acqui.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\IZNXQ65G\S0304399118300263.html","","","Digital image correlation; Crystal plasticity; Focused ion beam; SEM; Topography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High-resolution digital image correlation was performed during monotonic tensile tests to capture the local in-plane strain fields of the heterogeneous macrostructure of the weld. In the shoulder-affected region, banded macrostructures with heterogeneous mechanical properties were found. They were related to pronounced textures regions, which can be associated to strain-rate gradient during one rotation of the tool. The banded macrostructures in the nugget region were observed to be responsible for early plasticity in the joint and ultimately to be the fracture location of the weld. The heterogeneous mechanical response of the joint was also investigated by microhardness measurements. Differences were found between hardness and local tensile properties, demonstrating microhardness measurements can be misleading and only direct high-resolution digital image correlation techniques can document the mechanical behavior of materials having complex and heterogeneous micro-/macrostructures.","2016-10-15","2018-07-24 17:27:06","2018-07-24 17:27:06","","217-229","","","108","","Materials & Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\7A5GCJ8J\Texier et al. - 2016 - Near-surface mechanical heterogeneities in a dissi.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\3HWMSSQN\S026412751630853X.html","","","Friction stir welding (FSW); Digital image correlation (DIC); Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD); Texture; Aluminum alloys; Banded macrostructures; Microhardness; Dissimilar joint","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is well known that composites can be tailored to achieve desired mechanical and thermal properties in various directions and thus can be made fit-for-purpose if the proper combination of constituent materials and microstructures can be realized. In the present work, the first, multiscale, atomistically-informed, computational analysis of mechanical and thermal properties of a present day - Carbon/Phenolic composite Thermal Protection System  material is conducted. Model results are compared to measured in-plane and out-of-plane mechanical and thermal properties to validate the computational approach. Results indicate that given sufficient microstructural fidelity, along with lowerscale, constituent properties derived from molecular dynamics simulations, accurate composite level  thermo-elastic properties can be obtained. This suggests that next generation TPS properties can be accurately estimated via atomistically informed multiscale analysis.","2016-07-01","2018-09-06 21:42:03","2018-09-06 21:42:03","2018-09-06 21:42:03","","","","","","","Multiscale Modeling of Carbon/Phenolic Composite Thermal Protection Materials","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA NTRS","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\MAX5AYW5\Arnold - 2016 - Multiscale Modeling of CarbonPhenolic Composite T.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\JZKQX9C6\search.html","","","simulation; elastic properties; composite materials; ablation; carbon-phenolic composites; estimating; mechanical properties; microstructure; thermal protection; thermodynamic properties; woven composites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The images are acquired in-situ with optical cameras and an electron microscope. The strain mapping at the macro- and meso-scales allows semi-automatic detection of matrix cracks and quantification of their density evolution in function of the applied strain. The micro-scale examination provides additional insights into the failure mechanisms. The technique is developed and then applied to characterize transverse cracking in cross-ply carbon fiber/epoxy composites in the absence and presence of manufacturing defects (including voids). Laminates with defects were produced by lowering the autoclave pressure and the cure temperature, intentionally. The strain for cracking onset and the saturation crack density are found to be different in the inner and outer transverse plies of both types of laminates. The change in processing conditions that led to the presence of voids and incomplete matrix cure resulted in a lower strain for cracking onset and up to 3.5 times increase of the crack density in comparison with the reference material without defects.","2018-12-01","2018-09-21 17:49:04","2018-09-21 17:49:04","2018-09-21 17:49:04","138-147","","","154","","Composites Part B: Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Transverse cracking; Digital image correlation (DIC); Defects; Porosity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Quasi-isotropic carbon/epoxy laminates, with stacking sequence [452/902/-452/02]S defined as ply scaled and [45/90/-45/0]2S defined as sub-laminate scaled, were used. Specimens were cycled at 5 Hz with various amplitudes to 1 × 106 cycles unless failure occurred prior to this limit. For all cases an R ratio of 0.1 was used. Bolt washer pressures of 23 MPa and 70 MPa were investigated. For the ply-level case, the quasi-static test showed both delamination and fibre-dominated pull-out failures for a washer pressure of 23 MPa, and pull-out failure only for 70 MPa. Delamination dominates in fatigue tests. For the sub-laminate case the tests failed by pull-out in both quasi-static and fatigue tests for all washer pressures. It is shown in this paper how the role of delamination is critical in the case of fatigue loading and how this interacts with bolt clamp-up forces. A number of tests were analysed for damage using X-ray CT scanning and comparisons of damage are made with tests from previous open-hole studies.","2015-08-01","2018-09-24 19:03:03","2018-09-24 19:03:03","2018-09-24 19:03:03","462-473","","","77","","Composites Part B: Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","A.

At macroscopic scale, tensile tests reveal a significant modification of mechanical properties of the composite after water ageing. Then, an original test, combining tensile loading and X-ray microtomography, is performed on a ±45 hemp/epoxy composite material. The volume of damage inside two specimens (with and without water ageing) at several steps during a tensile test can be quantified.

Previous studies show that tension–compression fatigue is more detrimental than tension–tension fatigue to transverse and multidirectional laminates. By analysing the debonding mechanisms and modelling thereof, the macroscopic fatigue behaviour can be better understood. Also, the dominant crack-propagation mode can be identified which may be of use in selection of constituent material properties to optimise fatigue resistance. In this study, glass-fibre-reinforced vinyl-ester was used. The adverse effect of compressive load excursions was verified by counting the transverse cracks in cross-ply laminates. The mechanisms were studied in low-cycle fatigue of a specimen containing a single transverse fibre. Compressive load cycles led to significantly increased debond growth. In tension, contact zones developed at the crack tips for sufficiently large debonds. Because of the mismatch in elastic properties, an opening zone appeared at the tips of the interfacial crack when the same debond was subjected to a compressive load. Since debond propagation is more susceptible to mode I loading, the sensitivity to tension–compression fatigue is explained by the effective crack-tip opening in compressive loading for sufficiently large debond cracks. This has also been verified by finite-element analysis.","1999-02-01","2018-12-08 18:10:17","2018-12-08 18:10:17","2018-12-08 18:10:17","167-178","","2","59","","Composites Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\Y2GVNZR5\Gamstedt et Sjögren - 1999 - Micromechanisms in tension-compression fatigue of .pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\CFRM7BQY\S026635389800061X.html","","","A.

Following a review of the MSC.Dytran user manual, a bibliographical review of existing failure criteria of composites was performed. The papers considered most interesting for the objective of this report are discussed in section 2. The failure criteria included in the code under consideration are discussed in section 3. A critical summary of the present procedures to perform analysis and design of composites is presented in section 4. A study of the most important historical failure criteria for fibrous composite materials and some of the more recent modifications proposed were studied. The result of this analysis highlighted inadequacies in the existing failure criteria and the need to perform some numerical analyses to elucidate the answer to questions on which some of the proposed criteria are based. A summary of these ideas, which is a proposal of studies to be developed, is presented in section 5. Finally, some ideas for future developments are summarized in section 6.","2001-03-01","2018-12-15 18:56:00","2018-12-15 18:56:00","2018-12-15 18:56:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA NTRS","","","","C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\7XFWCK4B\Paris - 2001 - A Study of Failure Criteria of Fibrous Composite M.pdf; C:\Users\ilyass\Zotero\storage\J4L29QMY\search.html","","","failure; failure analysis; fiber composites; finite element method; laminates; numerical analysis; stress-strain relationships","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
