Previous modeling approaches are reviewed and their limitations identiﬁed. More accurate estimates of all nine elastic constants are obtained by modifying the analysis of Gibson and Ashby (1997) to account for the nodes at the intersection of the vertical and inclined members. The effect of the nodes becomes signiﬁcant at high relative densities. We then compare the new analytical equations with previous analytical models, with a numerical analysis based on a computational homogenization technique and with data for rubber honeycombs over a wide range of relative densities and cell geometries. The comparisons show that both the new analytical equations and numerical solutions give a remarkably good description of the data. The results provide new insights into understanding the mechanics of honeycombs and designing new cellular materials in the future.","2015-12","2019-05-21 22:32:27","2019-05-21 22:32:27","2019-05-21 22:32:27","226-240","","","91","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\momoe\Zotero\storage\KVTLKPK2\Malek et Gibson - 2015 - Effective elastic properties of periodic hexagonal.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Special attention is given to the lower and upper bounds of out-of-plane shear moduli for a generalized Malek and Gibson beam model and to a correction of Gibson and Ashby model. The imposed boundary conditions on a honeycomb cell presented in the ﬁrst part of this research are analyzed separately for the understanding of free and rigid skin effects. Then the ﬁnite element method is used to determine the effective elastic properties of the honeycomb cell and a comparison with existing and proposed analytical models is done. The numerical study considers both the free and rigid skin effects for two different ﬁnite elements types, Brick and Shell. The inﬂuence of including/neglecting the skin effect upon the effective elastic properties is presented and discussed. The ﬁnite element modeling (FEM) is performed by using APDL in ANSYS and a good agreement has been achieved between the results of the present analytical models and 3D FEM. Studies of convergence analyses by using Brick and Shell elements are performed for three sets of relative densities as a function of the mesh reﬁnement for the conventional, over-expanded, and re-entrant honeycombs. Some particularities in modeling with Shell elements are discussed by considering the number of layers and the section offset. A sensitivity analysis in terms of the geometric parameters of the unit cell has been conducted for analyzing the core thickness effect. The results provide new insights into understanding the limitations of present analytical models and opens perspectives for the detailed design of commercial honeycombs.","2018-04","2019-05-21 22:32:52","2019-05-21 22:32:52","2019-05-21 22:32:52","92-108","","","119","","","On the homogenization of hexagonal honeycombs under axial and shear loading.

More attention is paid to account for the radius of curvature of the inclined walls, the adhesive layer thickness, and adhesive ﬁllet at nodes. Then, neglecting the skin effect, in plane elastic constants is obtained analytically using the beam theory. The deformation mechanisms of the honeycomb cells include ﬂexure, stretching, shearing and hinging. The mechanism of hinging is included through small ﬁctitious beams in order to balance the local effects which cannot be captured using the beam theory. Hinging can be neglected when the thickness of these beams becomes inﬁnite or optimally chosen by a proper thickness as to minimize the cumulative errors of the analytical assumptions. The new analytic model presented in this paper can be particularized to the extended Balawi and Abot model if some parameters are adequately modiﬁed. The ﬁnite element modeling of a representative volume element is used for model calibration and validation considering different relative densities of real honeycombs. The numerical results obtained as a reference for the effective elastic constants are discussed by comparing them to the ones given by the analytic model; its advantages and pitfalls are discussed and explained through a case study and some sensitivity analyses. Numerical simulations are also done in order to establish the distribution of the stresses in cell walls and nodes to conﬁrm the hypotheses used for determining the analytical relations and to explain some limits of the analytic model.

Thus, two new analytical models are proposed: generalized Malek and Gibson and correction of Gibson and Ashby. Description of the existing (Malek and Gibson, 2015 and classical relations established by Gibson and Ashby, 1997) and proposed models is done in detail. All nine effective elastic properties are obtained analytically using the beam and membrane plate theory in which more attention is paid to account for the nodes at the intersection of the vertical and inclined cell walls. The numerical modeling of honeycomb structures is too tedious and time consuming. The homogenization of honeycombs enables to obtain an equivalent orthotropic homogeneous solid and its elastic effective properties making thus possible very eﬃcient ﬁnite element analyses. Such simulations are also used to establish the distribution of the stresses in nodes in order to validate the hypotheses used for determining the analytical relations. The existing and proposed analytical models are compared to the FEA solutions through two examples: one for a regular, and the other for a re-entrant honeycomb.

It was hypothesized that this modulation results from an altered cortical control of agonist and antagonist muscle activations. Eleven healthy participants performed 50 submaximal isometric ankle plantar flexion contractions. The force production phase effect (IFP, HFP and DFP) was assessed on the net joint torque stability, agonist and antagonist muscles activations, cortical activation, and corticomuscular coherence (CMC) with agonist and antagonist muscles. In comparison to HFP, the net joint torque stability, the agonist muscles activation and the CMC with agonist muscles were lower during IFP and even more during DFP. Antagonist muscle activations, cortical activations and CMC with antagonist muscles were higher during HFP than during IFP only. Increased CMC with agonist and antagonist muscles appeared to enhance the fine motor control. At a cortical level, agonist and antagonist muscle activations seemed to be controlled independently according to their muscle function and the phase of force production. Results revealed that CMC was an adequate measure to investigate the cortical regulation of agonist and antagonist muscle activations. This may have potential applications for patients with altered muscle activations.","2018-11","2019-05-21 23:57:37","2019-05-21 23:57:37","2019-05-21 23:57:37","3288-3298","","10","48","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\momoe\Zotero\storage\DR9GDMII\Desmyttere et al. - 2018 - Effect of the phase of force production on cortico.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Main outcome measures: Maximal isometric hip strength (adduction, abduction, internal and external rotation, ﬂexion and extension) was assessed using the GroinBar. Intraclass correlation coefﬁcient (ICC) and relative standard error of measurement (SEM) were calculated to evaluate reliability of peak (ICC3,1) (highest peak within 3 trials) and average peak (ICC3,3) (average of 3 trials) force and rate of force development (RFD). Hotelling's T2, were also used to compare bilateral and reciprocal ratios between dominant and non-dominant leg. Results: ICC for both peak force and RFD values revealed moderate to good reliability (0.53e0.88 and 0.61 e0.84, respectively), whereas reliability was good to excellent regarding their average values (0.77e0.95 and 0.81e0.92, respectively).

The aims of this study were therefore to determine the prevalence, correlates and impact of foot pain in a population-based sample of people aged 18 years and over living in the northwest region of Adelaide, South Australia. Methods: The North West Adelaide Health Study is a representative longitudinal cohort study of n = 4,060 people randomly selected and recruited by telephone interview. The second stage of data collection on this cohort was undertaken between mid 2004 and early 2006. In this phase, information regarding the prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions was included. Overall, n = 3,206 participants returned to the clinic during the second visit, and as part of the assessment were asked to report whether they had pain, aching or stiffness on most days in either of their feet. Data were also collected on body mass index (BMI); major medical conditions; other joint symptoms and health-related quality of life (the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 [SF-36]). Results: Overall, 17.4% (95% confidence interval 16.2 – 18.8) of participants indicated that they had foot pain, aching or stiffness in either of their feet. Females, those aged 50 years and over, classified as obese and who reported knee, hip and back pain were all significantly more likely to report foot pain. Respondents with foot pain scored lower on all domains of the SF-36 after adjustment for age, sex and BMI. Conclusion: Foot pain affects nearly one in five of people in the community, is associated with increased age, female sex, obesity and pain in other body regions, and has a significant detrimental impact on health-related quality of life.","2008-12","2019-05-21 23:57:42","2019-05-21 23:57:42","2019-05-21 23:57:42","","","1","1","","","Prevalence and correlates of foot pain in a population-based study","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\momoe\Zotero\storage\M6YRUXJZ\Hill et al. - 2008 - Prevalence and correlates of foot pain in a popula.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is based on the exact expression of the Green function of a linear elastic and homogeneous comparison material. First, the case of elastic nonhomogeneous constituents is considered and an iterative procedure is proposed to solve the Lippman-Schwinger equation which naturally arises in the problem. Then, the method is extended to non-linear constituents by a step-by-step integration in time. The accuracy of the method is assessed by varying the spatial resolution of the microstructures. The flexibility of the method allows it to serve for a large variety of microstructures. 0 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.","1998-04","2019-05-23 21:03:15","2019-05-23 21:03:15","2019-05-23 21:03:15","69-94","","1-2","157","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\momoe\Zotero\storage\W96D7F4M\Moulinec et Suquet - 1998 - A numerical method for computing the overall respo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are likely to be useful, in particular, for composites that have undergone a prior macroscopically uniform large deformation. To the extent that the statistics that are assumed may not be realized exactly, the formulae provide approximations. Since, however, they are derived as variational approximations for composites with some explicit statistics that are realizable, they are free from some of the drawbacks of competitor approximations such as that of Mori and Tanaka (1973 Acta Metall. 21,571-574), which can generate tensors of effective moduli which fail to satisfy a necessary symmetry requirement.

A quantitative deﬁnition of its size is proposed in this work. A RVE size can be associated with a given precision of the estimation of the wanted overall property and the number of realizations of a given volume V of microstructure that one is able to consider. It is shown to depend on the investigated morphological or physical property, the contrast in the properties of the constituents, and their volume fractions. The methodology is applied to a speciﬁc random microstructure, namely a two-phase three-dimensional Vorono€ı mosaic. Finite element simulations of volumes of diﬀerent sizes are performed in the case of linear elasticity and thermal conductivity. The volumes are subjected to homogeneous strain, stress or periodic boundary conditions. The eﬀective properties can be determined for large volumes and a small number of realizations. Conversely, smaller volumes can be used providing that a suﬃcient number of realizations are considered. A bias in the estimation of the eﬀective properties is observed for too small volumes for all types of boundary conditions. The variance of computed apparent properties for each volume size is used to deﬁne the precision of the estimation. The key-notion of integral range is introduced to relate this error estimation and the deﬁnition of the RVE size. For given wanted precision and number of realizations, one is able to provide a minimal volume size for the computation of eﬀective properties. The results can also be used to predict the minimal number of realizations that must be considered for a given volume size in order to estimate the eﬀective property for a given precision. The RVE sizes found for elastic and thermal properties, but also for a geometrical property like volume fraction, are compared.","2003-06","2019-05-23 21:15:44","2019-05-23 21:15:44","2019-05-23 21:15:44","3647-3679","","13-14","40","","","Determination of the size of the representative volume element for random composites","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\momoe\Zotero\storage\BBT5UFU4\Kanit et al. - 2003 - Determination of the size of the representative vo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For that purpose, ﬁnite element simulations based on explicit meshing of the microstructures are performed on six samples of the materials, with diﬀerent boundary conditions: kinematic uniform (KUBC), stress uniform (SUBC) and periodic boundary conditions. Direct simulations on the entire samples show that KUBC and SUBC provide strongly diﬀerent apparent properties, which rises the question of the representativity of the samples. A numerical and statistical computational homogenization methodology ﬁrst proposed for random models of microstructures in [Kanit et al., Determination of the size of the representative volume element for random composites: statistical and numerical approach, Int. J. Solids Struct. 40 (2003) 3647–3679] is extended here to the case of real microstructures in order to estimate the size of representative volume elements (RVE) for both materials. The samples of material A are found to be representative, whereas at least twice as large sample volumes would be necessary to predict the properties of material B with a precision of 5%. Numerical predictions of the eﬀective properties using simulations on a large number of subdomains extracted from the samples with periodic boundary conditions are in satisfactory agreement with available experimental results. In particular, material A is twice as stiﬀ as material B. This is due to a diﬀerent percolation behaviour of the hard phase in the materials, which is investigated in the last section of the article. Indicators of geometrical and mechanical percolation, especially relevant for connected microstructures, are proposed and estimated using 3D image analysis.","2006-07","2019-05-23 21:15:46","2019-05-23 21:15:46","2019-05-23 21:15:46","3960-3982","","33-36","195","","","Apparent and effective physical properties of heterogeneous materials","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\momoe\Zotero\storage\34DF4G3Z\Kanit et al. - 2006 - Apparent and effective physical properties of hete.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, the number of unknown functions involved in the present theory is only ﬁve, as opposed to six or even greater numbers in the case of other shear and normal deformation theories. The present theory accounts for both shear deformation and thickness stretching effects by a hyperbolic variation of all displacements across the thickness, and satisﬁes the stress-free boundary conditions on the upper and lower surfaces of the plate without requiring any shear correction factor. Equations of motion are derived from Hamilton’s principle. Analytical solutions for the bending and free vibration analysis are obtained for simply supported plates. The obtained results are compared with 3-dimensional and quasi-3-dimensional solutions and those predicted by other plate theories. It can be concluded that the present theory is not only accurate but also simple in predicting the bending and free vibration responses of functionally graded plates.","2014-04","2019-05-23 22:32:45","2019-05-23 22:32:45","2019-05-23 22:32:45","274-283","","","60","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\momoe\Zotero\storage\QRGUSN4H\Belabed et al. - 2014 - An efficient and simple higher order shear and nor.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A large validation campaign was conducted and the Representative Volume Element (RVE) was rigorously determined for each combination of phases mechanical properties, particles volume fraction and aspect ratio. The load independent properties computed numerically were compared to those predicted by a range of analytical models. The study revealed that the original Benveniste’s interpretation of the Mori–Tanaka scheme led to the most accurate ﬁrst order moments and intra-matrix second order moments, provided that the mechanical properties contrast between the particles and the matrix are low. For higher contrasts, Lielens’ model delivers the most accurate estimates. The self-consistent scheme is the most suited model to predict the intra-particle second order moments when the particles aspect ratio is low. For particles with high aspect ratio, Lielens’ model could be an alternative to the self-consistent scheme.

They are likely to be useful, in particular, for composites that have undergone a prior macroscopically uniform large deformation. To the extent that the statistics that are assumed may not be realized exactly, the formulae provide approximations. Since, however, they are derived as variational approximations for composites with some explicit statistics that are realizable, they are free from some of the drawbacks of competitor approximations such as that of Mori and Tanaka (1973 Acta Metall. 21,571-574), which can generate tensors of effective moduli which fail to satisfy a necessary symmetry requirement.

The algorithm is based on molecular dynamics where the ellipsoids are set in translational and rotational motion and their volumes gradually increase. Binary collision times are computed by simply ﬁnding the roots of a non-linear function. In addition, an original and eﬃcient method to compute the collision time between an ellipsoid and a cube face is proposed. The algorithm can generate all types of ellipsoids (prolate, oblate and scalene) with very high aspect ratios (i.e., > 10). It is the ﬁrst time that such packings are reported in the literature. Orientations tensors were computed for the generated packings and it has been shown that ellipsoids had a uniform distribution of orientations. Moreover, it seems that for low aspect ratios (i.e., 10), the volume fraction is the most inﬂuential parameter on the algorithm CPU time. For higher aspect ratios, the inﬂuence of the latter becomes as important as the volume fraction.

The numerical predictions were compared to those of the analytical models for a wide range of phases mechanical properties, ﬁbers volume fractions and aspect ratios. The validation campaign involved a rigorous Representative Volume Element (RVE) determination process and approximately, 66,000 simulations were performed. The results show that the analytical models accuracy is more sensitive to the mechanical properties contrasts than to the ﬁbers volume fraction and aspect ratio. Among all the studied models, Lielens’ model remains the most accurate, especially for high contrasts and volume fractions. For high aspect ratio ﬁbers, Lielens’s model and Beveniste’s interpretation of the Mori–Tanaka model provide similar estimates, especially when predicting the effective shear modulus. In this case, the latter could be an alternative to Lielens’ model, especially for composites where the ﬁbers are not completely stiffer than the matrix. All conclusions of this study apply to both prolate and oblate ellipsoidal ﬁbers. Ó 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the ®rst paper we focus on the theory of the homogenization method where we are concerned with the main concepts and derivation of the equations for computation of eective constitutive parameters of complex materials with a periodic micro structure. Such materials are described by the base cell, which is the smallest repetitive unit of material, and the evaluation of the eective constitutive parameters may be carried out by analysing the base cell alone. For simple microstructures this may be achieved analytically, whereas for more complicated systems numerical methods such as the ®nite element method must be employed. In the second paper, we consider numerical and analytical solutions of the homogenization equations. Topology optimization of structures is a rapidly growing research area, and as opposed to shape optimization allows the introduction of holes in structures, with consequent savings in weight and improved structural characteristics. The homogenization approach, with an emphasis on the optimality criteria method, will be the topic of the third paper in this review. # 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In particular, the AEH is a useful technique to study of the behaviour of structural components built with composite materials. The main advantages of this approach lie on the fact that (i) it allows a signiﬁcant reduction of the problem size and (ii) it has the capability to characterise stress and deformation microﬁelds. In fact, speciﬁc equations can be developed to deﬁne these ﬁelds, in a process designated by localisation and not found on typical homogenisation methods. In the AEH methodology, overall material properties can be derived from the mechanical behaviour of selected periodic microscale representative volumes (also known as representative unit-cells, RUC). Nevertheless, unit-cell based modelling requires the control of some parameters, such as reinforcement volume fraction, geometry and distribution within the matrix material. The need for variety and ﬂexibility leads to the development of automatic geometry generation algorithms. Additionally, the unstructured ﬁnite element meshes required by these RUC are usually non-periodic and involve the control of speciﬁc periodic boundary conditions. This work presents some numerical procedures developed in order to support ﬁnite element AEH implementations, rendering them more efﬁcient and less user-dependent. The authors also present a numerical study of the inﬂuence of the reinforcement volume fraction on the overall material properties for a metal matrix composite (MMC) reinforced with spherical ceramic particles.

In the new algorithm, an equivalent harmonic analysis is established and a double-layer elements method is proposed to solve the local problem in the homogenization process. On the basis of the new algorithm, the effective complex moduli can be obtained easily by using commercial software to serve as a black box.

A quantitative deﬁnition of its size is proposed in this work. A RVE size can be associated with a given precision of the estimation of the wanted overall property and the number of realizations of a given volume V of microstructure that one is able to consider. It is shown to depend on the investigated morphological or physical property, the contrast in the properties of the constituents, and their volume fractions. The methodology is applied to a speciﬁc random microstructure, namely a two-phase three-dimensional Vorono€ı mosaic. Finite element simulations of volumes of diﬀerent sizes are performed in the case of linear elasticity and thermal conductivity. The volumes are subjected to homogeneous strain, stress or periodic boundary conditions. The eﬀective properties can be determined for large volumes and a small number of realizations. Conversely, smaller volumes can be used providing that a suﬃcient number of realizations are considered. A bias in the estimation of the eﬀective properties is observed for too small volumes for all types of boundary conditions. The variance of computed apparent properties for each volume size is used to deﬁne the precision of the estimation. The key-notion of integral range is introduced to relate this error estimation and the deﬁnition of the RVE size. For given wanted precision and number of realizations, one is able to provide a minimal volume size for the computation of eﬀective properties. The results can also be used to predict the minimal number of realizations that must be considered for a given volume size in order to estimate the eﬀective property for a given precision. The RVE sizes found for elastic and thermal properties, but also for a geometrical property like volume fraction, are compared.","2003-06","2019-05-23 22:34:42","2019-05-23 22:34:42","2019-05-23 22:34:42","3647-3679","","13-14","40","","","Determination of the size of the representative volume element for random composites","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\momoe\Zotero\storage\LDIQF7XN\Kanit et al. - 2003 - Determination of the size of the representative vo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For that purpose, ﬁnite element simulations based on explicit meshing of the microstructures are performed on six samples of the materials, with diﬀerent boundary conditions: kinematic uniform (KUBC), stress uniform (SUBC) and periodic boundary conditions. Direct simulations on the entire samples show that KUBC and SUBC provide strongly diﬀerent apparent properties, which rises the question of the representativity of the samples.

The samples of material A are found to be representative, whereas at least twice as large sample volumes would be necessary to predict the properties of material B with a precision of 5%. Numerical predictions of the eﬀective properties using simulations on a large number of subdomains extracted from the samples with periodic boundary conditions are in satisfactory agreement with available experimental results. In particular, material A is twice as stiﬀ as material B. This is due to a diﬀerent percolation behaviour of the hard phase in the materials, which is investigated in the last section of the article.

In this contribution, focusing on matrix-inclusion composites, a novel computational homogenization framework is proposed such that standard continuum models at the micro-scale translate onto the macroscale to recover a micromorphic continuum. Departing from the conventional FE2 framework where a macroscopic strain tensor characterizes the average deformation within the RVE, our formulation introduces an additional macro kinematic ﬁeld to characterize the average strain in the inclusions. The two macro kinematic ﬁelds, each characterizing a particular aspect of deformation within the RVE, thus provide critical information on the underlying rapid ﬂuctuations. The net effect of these ﬂuctuations, as well as the interactions between RVEs, are next incorporated naturally into the macroscopic virtual power statement through the Hill-Mandel condition. The excellent predictive capability of the proposed homogenization framework is illustrated through three benchmark examples.

This speciﬁc value is obtained using an equation proposed in this study; the value depends only on the geometry of the honeycomb. As a consequence of the necessity that the ratio of Mxyjunit and Myxjunit should become a speciﬁc value, if the ratio of torsional load moments Mx1y and M1 yx acting on the boundaries is not actually equal to the above-mentioned value, scattering appears near the boundary in the ratio of Mxyjunit and Myxjunit, and the ratio approaches the above-mentioned speciﬁc value as the distance from the boundary increases.

Calculation of stress stiffness utilizes stresses responses obtained by homogenization–localization analysis employing twelve unit-cell models. In this regard, the homogenization–localization analysis is carried out by relieving periodicity in the thickness direction. The buckling analysis employs two modeling techniques, i.e. face modeling and face-core modeling, whereby the critical eigenvalues are found to be sensitive to the selected technique. In order to better understand the inﬂuence of out-of-plane periodicity, the results of standard analysis with three-dimensional periodicity are also presented.

At room temperature many polymers are found to be near their glass temperature. Elastic moduli of honeycombs made of such materials are not constant, but changes in the time or frequency domain. Thus consideration of viscoelastic properties are essential for such honeycombs. Irregularity in lattice structures being inevitable from practical point of view, analysis of the compound eﬀect considering both irregularity and viscoelasticity is crucial for such structural forms. On the basis of a mechanics based bottom-up approach, computationally eﬃcient closed-form formulae are derived in frequency domain. The spatially correlated structural and material attributes are obtained based on Karhunen–Loève expansion, which is integrated with the developed analytical approach to quantify the viscoelastic eﬀect for irregular lattices. Consideration of such spatially correlated behaviour can simulate the practical stochastic system more closely. The two eﬀective complex Young’s moduli and shear modulus are found to be dependent on the viscoelastic parameters, while the two in-plane eﬀective Poisson’s ratios are found to be independent of viscoelastic parameters and frequency. Results are presented in both deterministic and stochastic regime, wherein it is observed that the amplitude of Young’s moduli and shear modulus are signiﬁcantly ampliﬁed in the frequency domain. The response bounds are quantiﬁed considering two diﬀerent forms of irregularity, randomly inhomogeneous irregularity and randomly homogeneous irregularity.

The results provide new insights into understanding the mechanics of honeycombs and facilitate the design of new types of cellular materials, including composite hexagonal cell cores.","2019-01","2019-05-23 22:35:59","2019-05-23 22:35:59","2019-05-23 22:35:59","87-106","","","156-157","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\momoe\Zotero\storage\8SLWUZ4V\Sorohan et al. - 2019 - In-plane homogenization of commercial hexagonal ho.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also numerically investigate the dynamic properties of the sandwich plates with hexagonal cores. By taking into account the bending, axial and shearing deformations of the unit cell walls, the effective elastic constants are derived. In order to analyze the wave propagation of the sandwich plates, the original governing equations are converted into a set of the ﬁrst-order governing differential equations in the Hamilton system, by introducing the dual variables and with the help of a variational principle. The precise integration method in conjunction with the extended Wittrick-Williams algorithm is utilized to numerically solve these equations to obtain the frequencies of structures. The effects of relative density, length ratio, cell wall angle and material distribution parameter on the dispersion relations of hexagonal and re-entrant hexagonal structures are investigated.

The multiscale design involves two optimization stages: the free material distribution optimization and the concurrent topology optimization. Firstly, the variable thickness sheet (VTS) method with the regularization mechanism is used to generate multiple element density distributions in the macro design domain. Hence, different groups of elements with the identical densities can be uniformly arranged in their corresponding domains, and each domain in the space will be periodically configured by a unique representative microstructure. Secondly, with the discrete material distributions achieved in the macro domain, the topology of the macrostructure and topologies of multiple representative microstructures are concurrently optimized by a parametric level set method combined with the numerical homogenization method.

The aims of this study were therefore to determine the prevalence, correlates and impact of foot pain in a population-based sample of people aged 18 years and over living in the northwest region of Adelaide, South Australia. Methods: The North West Adelaide Health Study is a representative longitudinal cohort study of n = 4,060 people randomly selected and recruited by telephone interview. The second stage of data collection on this cohort was undertaken between mid 2004 and early 2006. In this phase, information regarding the prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions was included. Overall, n = 3,206 participants returned to the clinic during the second visit, and as part of the assessment were asked to report whether they had pain, aching or stiffness on most days in either of their feet. Data were also collected on body mass index (BMI); major medical conditions; other joint symptoms and health-related quality of life (the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 [SF-36]). Results: Overall, 17.4% (95% confidence interval 16.2 – 18.8) of participants indicated that they had foot pain, aching or stiffness in either of their feet. Females, those aged 50 years and over, classified as obese and who reported knee, hip and back pain were all significantly more likely to report foot pain.

Results: A sample of 40 feet was studied, showing statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences between venous ﬁlling time (P < 0.001) and in the ejection fraction (P < 0.001) with CFO utilization versus without use of CFO. Conclusions: Healthy people who utilize CFO evidenced an increased venous return in the feet. 1.

Eleven healthy participants performed 50 submaximal isometric ankle plantar flexion contractions. The force production phase effect (IFP, HFP and DFP) was assessed on the net joint torque stability, agonist and antagonist muscles activations, cortical activation, and corticomuscular coherence (CMC) with agonist and antagonist muscles. In comparison to HFP, the net joint torque stability, the agonist muscles activation and the CMC with agonist muscles were lower during IFP and even more during DFP. Antagonist muscle activations, cortical activations and CMC with antagonist muscles were higher during HFP than during IFP only. Increased CMC with agonist and antagonist muscles appeared to enhance the fine motor control. At a cortical level, agonist and antagonist muscle activations seemed to be controlled independently according to their muscle function and the phase of force production.

However, since the adjustment of elastic modulus on certain regions of insole can hardly be achieved via materials selection, a porous structural unit with varying porosity becomes a feasible way. Therefore, porous structural units associated with adjustable effective modulus and porosity can be employed to construct such insoles by 3D printing manufacturing technology. This paper presents a study on the porous structural units in terms of the geometrical parameters, porosity, and their correlations with the effective modulus. To achieve this goal, ﬁnite element analyses were carried out on porous structural units, and mechanical tests were carried out on the 3D printed samples for validation purposes. In this case, the mathematical relationships between the effective modulus and the key geometrical parameters were derived and subsequently employed in the construction of an insole model.

A new design method is proposed in this study for optimizing the stress distribution of the contact surfaces between the foot and the insole by applying functional gradient structural properties to the insole. Finite element analysis was employed for studying the contact mechanics, which laid the foundation for modulus readjustment during the optimization process. The moduli of the materials were correlated to the properties of the structural porous units. The customized insoles were manufactured using additive manufacturing technology and put into mechanical test. Results show that the designed insole helps in increasing the foot contact area by approximately 30% and reducing the peak contact pressure by 35%. Hence, the proposed method can be used to design customized insoles, particularly diabetic insoles, by oﬀering better contact mechanics and good potential for reducing the severity of diabetic foot.

However, removable cast walkers (RCWs) became an alternative option especially after resolution of the acute stage. RCWs with an elevated sole construction often induce leg length discrepancy (LLD) that could signiﬁcantly aﬀects plantar pressure (PP) distribution in diabetic patients with neuropathy. Aim: To study the additional eﬀect of walking speed on PP abnormalities induced by LLD. Method: The study included 16 patients with diabetes (59 ± 8.8 years; 8 men and 8 women), with unilateral CN oﬄoaded by RCW. In-shoe PP distribution was measured using F-scan (Tekscan Inc.), whilst patients walked at their normal speed (53 ± 4 steps/min), versus short slow steps (24 ± 3/min) under the two walking conditions: (1) neglected LLD, and (2) corrected LLD. Results: The greatest reduction in PP was seen during reduction of walking speed, with corrected LLD, followed by corrected LLD with normal walking speed, followed by neglected LLD with slowing of walking speed. The highest PP was found when the patient remain on their normal walking speed and LLD was neglected. Conclusion: The contralateral foot of CN oﬄoaded with RCW, is subjected to high pressure loads beneath the hallux, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th metatarsal heads. As such, care should be taken not only to avoid minor LLD, but to also advise the patient to practice short slow steps while walking, so that pressure overload on contralateral limb and its possible contribution to the development of bilateral Charcot, could be minimized.","2019-06","2019-05-23 22:41:46","2019-05-23 22:41:46","2019-05-23 22:41:46","15-21","","","39","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\momoe\Zotero\storage\67W6YYV7\Motawea et al. - 2019 - Pressure distribution under the contralateral limb.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The shank, calcaneus, mid-foot and metatarsus were assumed to be 3D rigid bodies. The longitudinal axis of the ﬁrst, second and ﬁfth metatarsal bones and the proximal phalanx of the hallux were also tracked independently. Skin markers were mounted on bony prominences or joint lines, avoiding the course of main tendons. Trajectories of the 14 markers were collected by an eight-camera motion capture system at 100 Hz on a population of 10 young volunteers. Three-dimensional joint rotations and planar angles were calculated according to anatomically based reference frames. The marker set was well visible throughout the stance phase of gait, even in a camera conﬁguration typical of gait analysis of the full body. The time-histories of the joint rotations and planar angles were well repeatable among subjects and consistent with clinical and biomechanical knowledge. Several dynamic measurements were originally taken, such as elevation/drop of the medial longitudinal arch and of three metatarsal bones, rear-foot to fore-foot rotation and transverse plane deformation of the metatarsus.

Conclusion: This study has established whole of life normative reference values of widely used spatiotemporal and plantar pressure parameters, and revealed changes to be expected across the lifespan.","2017-10","2019-05-23 22:42:03","2019-05-23 22:42:03","2019-05-23 22:42:03","78-87","","","58","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\momoe\Zotero\storage\WB86EVT5\McKay et al. - 2017 - Spatiotemporal and plantar pressure patterns of 10.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: In a randomised, cross-over trial, 15 flat-footed participants aged between 18 and 45 years were provided with semi-rigid, customised orthoses and semi-rigid, contoured, prefabricated orthoses. Pressures and forces were measured using an in-shoe system with subjects wearing shoes alone, wearing customised orthoses, and again when wearing contoured prefabricated orthoses. Two weeks acclimatisation was included between cross-over of therapy. Repeated measures ANOVA models with post-hoc, pair-wise comparisons were used to test for differences. Results: When compared to wearing shoes alone, wearing either the customised orthoses or the prefabricated orthoses was associated with increases in force and force time integrals in the midfoot region. Peak and maximum mean pressure and pressure-time, and force-time integrals were reduced in both the medial and lateral forefoot. There were, however, no significant differences between the customised orthoses and the prefabricated orthoses at any site. Conclusion: There was a similar change in loading with both the semi-rigid customised and the semi-rigid prefabricated orthoses when compared to the shoe alone condition. However, while customised devices offered minor differences over prefabricated orthoses in some variables, these were not statistically significant. The results suggest that there may be only minor differences in the effects on plantar pressures between the customised and the less expensive prefabricated orthoses tested in this study, however further research is warranted.","2009-12","2019-05-23 22:42:04","2019-05-23 22:42:04","2019-05-23 22:42:04","","","1","2","","","Contoured, prefabricated foot orthoses demonstrate comparable mechanical properties to contoured, customised foot orthoses","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\momoe\Zotero\storage\KWMUQCIA\Redmond et al. - 2009 - Contoured, prefabricated foot orthoses demonstrate.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Experimental, repeated-measures. Setting: University clinic and laboratory. Participants: Eighteen symptom-free adults with flat-arched feet. Interventions: Customized foot orthoses. Main Outcome Measures: In-shoe foot biomechanics were measured during walking with and without customized foot orthoses using 3D analysis. Selected kinematic and kinetic variables during baseline walking were compared between subgroups who displayed reductions in calcaneal eversion with foot orthoses to those with no change or increases. Results: Biomechanical responders displayed significantly greater peak calcaneal eversion (+2.2 degrees, P 5 0.009). Time to peak calcaneal eversion (211%, P 5 0.006), peak dorsiflexion of the hallux (26 degrees, P 5 0.001), and medial–lateral excursion of the center of pressure during loading response were all reduced in the responder subgroup (22 mm, P # 0.001). Variables significantly different between subgroups were moderately associated with the response to foot orthoses (canonical correlation 5 0.687, effect size 5 0.47, P 5 0.063). Conclusions: Individuals with increased dynamic foot pronation were more likely to show a favorable biomechanical response to customized foot orthoses, providing preliminary evidence to support the stratified use of foot orthoses to optimize their effectiveness.","2018-07","2019-05-23 22:42:05","2019-05-23 22:42:05","2019-05-23 22:42:05","398-400","","4","28","","","Predictors of the Biomechanical Effects of Customized Foot Orthoses in Adults With Flat-Arched Feet","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\momoe\Zotero\storage\7T6WITLT\Arnold et al. - 2018 - Predictors of the Biomechanical Effects of Customi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: A repeated measures study with randomised order of orthoses, hardness, and posting conditions. Methods: Twenty-three cyclists cycled at a cadence of 90 rpm and a perceived exertion rating of twelve. Contoured soft and hard orthoses with or without a medial forefoot or lateral forefoot post were evaluated. Plantar contact area, mean pressure and peak pressure were measured for nine plantar regions using the pedar® -X system and represented as a percentage of the total (CA%, MP%, and PP% respectively). Perceived comfort and support was rated on a visual analogue scale. Results: The softer orthosis signiﬁcantly increased CA% (p = 0.014) across the midfoot and heel with a decrease in the toe region and forefoot. MP% (p = 0.034) and PP% (p = 0.012) were signiﬁcantly increased at the mid and lateral forefoot with reductions in MP% at the midfoot and in PP% at the hallux and toes. Forefoot posting signiﬁcantly increased CA% (p = 0.018) at the toes and forefoot and decreased it at the heel. PP% was signiﬁcantly altered (p = 0.013) based on posting position. Lateral forefoot posting signiﬁcantly decreased heel comfort (p = 0.036). Conclusion: When cycling, a soft, contoured orthosis increased contact across the midfoot and heel, modulating forefoot and midfoot plantar pressures but not altering comfort or support. Forefoot postings signiﬁcantly modiﬁed contact areas and plantar pressures and reduced comfort at the heel.","2018-07","2019-05-23 22:42:06","2019-05-23 22:42:06","2019-05-23 22:42:06","691-696","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\momoe\Zotero\storage\MHCB9BUI\Bousie et al. - 2018 - Hardness and posting of foot orthoses modify plant.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method is based on the bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique. The optimization problem is formulated as ﬁnding a micro-structural topology with the maximum bulk or shear modulus under a prescribed volume constraint. Using the homogenization theory and ﬁnite element analysis within a periodic base cell (PBC), elemental sensitivity numbers are established for gradually removing and adding elements in PBC. Numerical examples in 2D and 3D demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for achieving convergent microstructures of cellular materials with maximum bulk or shear modulus. Some interesting topological patterns have been found for guiding the cellular material design.","2011-04","2019-05-23 22:44:24","2019-05-23 22:44:24","2019-05-23 22:44:24","1861-1870","","6","50","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\momoe\Zotero\storage\Y56QCVXD\Huang et al. - 2011 - Topological design of microstructures of cellular .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
