# Perfect numbers

 > In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).
>The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. 
>Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. 
 
* Your function should input a **number** (any integer number)
* Your function should return the **boolean value** `False` or `True`

> Hint: `message = False` affects the **boolean value** `False` to message. Not `false`, `False`. `False` is not a string, not an integer, it is a boolean.
