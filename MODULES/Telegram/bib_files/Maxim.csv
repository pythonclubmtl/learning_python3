This paper investigates the feasibility of a combined introduction of both the surface and sub-surface compressive residual stress on Ti6Al4V material through a successive application of the two aforementioned processes, one after the other. CRS profiles between individual processes were compared to that of combination of processes to validate the feasibility. It was found out that shot peening introduces surface compressive residual stress into the already deep cold rolled sample, resulting in both surface and sub-surface compressive residual stresses in the material. However the drawback of such a combination would be the increased surface roughness after shot peening a deep cold rolled sample which can be critical especially in compressor components. Hence, a new technology, Vibro-Peening (VP) may be used as an alternative to SP to introduce surface stress at reduced roughness.","2016-11","2019-04-26 15:28:47","2019-04-26 15:28:47","2019-04-26 15:28:47","012013","","","157","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\mapaqr\Zotero\storage\A699XUE2\Gopinath et al. - 2016 - Introduction of Enhanced Compressive Residual Stre.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The depth of plastically strained region was estimated using a quantitative analysis of grain orientation spread (GOS) data from electron back-scattered diﬀraction (EBSD) technique.

The latter is almost a quasi-static process while the former features extremely high strain-rate deformation. The synchrotron based high-energy X-ray diﬀraction was employed to investigate the through-thickness residual strain distribution. The studied two samples after the two processing procedures share the following features: (i) the pressure aﬀected depths are both ~2 mm and (ii) the largest magnitudes of the compressive residual strains parallel to the surface are ~4,000 με. However, the pit depth for the indentation sample is ~9 times larger than that for the LSP. The position featuring the largest magnitude of the compressive residual strain is in the sub-surface for the indentation while it is in the surface for the LSP. Results of the elastic-visco-plastic ﬁnite element simulation for the indentation indicate that the position featuring the maximum accumulative plastic shear as deﬁned in this paper corresponds to the location with the largest magnitude of compressive residual strain. To validate this ﬁnding, full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the X-ray diﬀraction proﬁle, which is proportional to the level of the plastic deformation, is also studied. It is found that positions with the largest FWHM indeed correspond to the largest magnitude of compressive residual strain for both tests.","2018-01","2019-04-26 15:29:07","2019-04-26 15:29:07","2019-04-26 15:29:07","140-145","","","714","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\mapaqr\Zotero\storage\NCSNUULB\Xie et al. - 2018 - The in-depth residual strain heterogeneities due t.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The immediate application of this information is to the problem of foreign object damage (FOD) associated with the ingestion of debris into an aircraft turbine engine and the subsequent reduction in component lifetime. The work is focused on two primary features: (i) the development of numerical models for the evaluation of the deformation and stresses associated with the impact process and (ii) the use of spatially resolved residual stress measurements to verify experimentally the numerical analysis. As a ®rst approximation, a quasi-static numerical model was developed by ignoring time-dependent eects (i.e., strain-rate sensitivity, wave and inertia eects, etc.), where the eects of velocity were approximated by adjusting the depth and diameter of the resulting impact crater to match that of actual impact craters at the corresponding velocity. The computed residual stresses and associated elastic strain gradients were compared to experimentally measured values, obtained using synchrotron X-ray diraction (XRD) methods. This comparison indicated that the quasi-static numerical analysis was adequate for moderate impact conditions (velocity  200 m/s, energy  2.7 J); however, under more aggressive conditions (velocity  300 m/s, energy  6.1 J), there was signi®cant discrepancy between the numerical predictions and experimental measurements. Such discrepancy may be attributed to several factors that can occur at higher impact velocities, including strain-rate sensitivity, microcrack formation, and shear-band formation. A dynamic simulation, where the time-dependent eects of strain-rate sensitivity and elastic-wave interactions were approximated, provided results in closer agreement with the experimental diraction observations.

The output is a quantitative measure of the depth of strain-hardening eﬀects. The tool is used at various shot-peening intensities to demonstrate the ability to distinguish between these changes, using a range of intensities from 4 to 10 Almen. An increase in shot-peening intensity is observed to increase the depth of strain-hardening eﬀects in the alloy. A comparison with residual stress measurements using X-ray diffraction for the same material shows that the strain-hardened depth determined by EBSD extends to approximately half the distance of the residual stress present due to shot peening. A comparison is also made with predicted proﬁles from the PeenstressSM model and subsequent microhardness testing. A positive correlation is observed between strained hardened depth and surface roughness of the peened samples.

The residual substructures of post-shock Ti64 are dominated by planar slip. A few deformation twins is also formed in alloy shocked at 14.05 GPa. The lack of dislocation cells or cell-like structures, additional strengthening phases such as ω phase and high-density twins limits the further strengthening of this alloy through shock loading.

"5MJL5IP5","journalArticle","","Moschetti, Michael","Experimental and Finite Element Analysis of Shot Peen Forming","","","","","","Shot peen forming is a cold work process where plastic deformation - induced by high velocity impact of small shot - results in the deformation of the workpiece. Shot peen forming is typically used during the formation of wing skins, where other manufacturing methods are not feasible, either due to process inadequacy or prohibitive cost. Current simulation procedures are limited in capability, requiring complex non-linear simulations which are computationally expensive - especially when they must be performed for each treatment and material - and often require empirical adjustment anyway. A wholly empirical approach requires the development of a large parametric database, and any parameter deviating from the database must be investigated individually. Additionally, this approach is often internalised within the minds of a few seasoned professionals of the industry, which renders analytical analysis diﬃcult, and facilitates the risk of loss of knowledge. This paper investigates a method proposed by Faucheux et al. (2017b), which aims to determine equivalent peening loads via a small set of representative experiments, potentially providing a reduction to the amount of work necessary to predict required input parameters needed to form a workpiece to a target shape. To this end, numerous coupons were peened under diﬀerent conditions and, in combination with simulation data, the equivalent peening induced loads were predicted. The method developed some promising results, with appropriate order of magnitude loads determined for some groups of coupons. However, multiple non-physical results highlighted sensitivities in the procedure, which require further work to understand.","","2019-04-26 15:29:38","2019-04-26 15:29:38","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\mapaqr\Zotero\storage\V8FW58LI\Moschetti - Experimental and Finite Element Analysis of Shot P.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The process adapts conventional vibratory deburring process treatment parameters, by using ceramic abrasive granules followed by steel ball bearing media to achieve a surface enhancement with a predictable fatigue benefit. The benefit is obtained by a combination of surface smoothing and imposition of residual compressive stress to the surface of the component.

The resulting bulk ﬂow entrains workpieces and exposes their surfaces to the impacts resulting from the small-scale media vibrations. The bulk ﬂow is responsible for entrainment and mixing, while the media vibration does work on the surfaces. The selection of machine vibration parameters is commonly based on experience due to the difﬁculty in predicting the ﬂuidized bed behavior. In this work, a discrete element method was used to investigate how the bulk ﬂow in an actual tub ﬁnisher ﬁlled with steel balls depends on the tub motion parameters through a parametric study. The underlying mechanisms that create and drive the bulk ﬂow were identiﬁed by examining the relationships between the bulk ﬂow rates and the wall forces. Finally, the connection between the wall motion and the wall forces was investigated. The tub frequency was the most effective control parameter and there was an optimal phase difference between the horizontal and vertical vibrations to maximize bulk ﬂow. The relationship between the media packing at the walls and the tangential forces between the walls and the media explained the formation and speed of the bulk ﬂow. Lastly, it was shown that the tangential wall forces, unlike the normal forces, cannot be obtained from the known wall motion alone since they also depend on the media velocities relative to the walls.","2018-08","2019-04-26 15:42:15","2019-04-26 15:42:15","2019-04-26 15:42:15","","","3","20","","","Bulk mass flow in a vibratory finisher","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\mapaqr\Zotero\storage\7PRKN563\da Silva Maciel et Spelt - 2018 - Bulk mass flow in a vibratory finisher mechanisms.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the experimental observations, a grain reﬁnement mechanism induced by plastic deformation during the SMA treatment in Fe was proposed. It involves formation of dense dislocation walls (DDWs) and dislocation tangles (DTs) in original grains and in the reﬁned cells (under further straining) as well, transformation of DDWs and DTs into subboundaries with small misorientations separating individual cells or subgrains, and evolution of subboundaries to highly misoriented grain boundaries.

This was accomplished by using the effective and quick method of angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction (AD-XRD). LPwC was performed on the titanium TC6 and Ti-6Al-4V alloys with a laser wavelength of 1064 and 532 nm and samples were peened with three different laser power densities of 3, 6 and 9 GW cm-2 and subjected to multiple impacts (1/3/5). Followed by that, the residual stress measurements using synchrotron radiation beam energy (SRBE) of 20 and 30 keV were carried out. The results show that LPwC induces higher and deep residual stress depending upon the titanium alloy. The change of residual stress with laser power densities and impact times are calculated and discussed. Although a compressive residual stress (CRS) was observed in majority of the cases, the more detrimental tensile residual stress (TRS) was observed in few cases only, especially with the TC6 alloy. TC6 showed TRS with peening radiations of 532 nm (power density of 3 GW cm-2) and 1064 nm (power density of 9 GW cm-2). Besides, TRS was observed in multiple peened samples (5 times) at both radiations. In each of the instances the residual stress was measured at SRBE of 20 keV. It is suggested that for beneficial CRS, peening may be employed in conditions other than these.","2019-07","2019-05-14 13:30:38","2019-05-14 13:30:38","2019-05-14 13:30:38","518-525","","","140","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\mapaqr\Zotero\storage\VGAR9ZMZ\Umapathi et Swaroop - 2019 - Measurement of residual stresses in titanium alloy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Without cavitation peening, the hydrogen effect on the crack growth behavior at low applied stress was clearly demonstrated compared with high applied stress in the fatigue test. The coalescence of subcracks and the main crack propagating from the pre-crack were observed in the hydrogen charged specimen. This phenomenon signiﬁcantly accelerated the crack growth. This unexpected fracture was suppressed by introducing compressive residual stress by cavitation peening regardless of the length of processing time. In addition, lengthier treatment reduced the crack growth rate of the hydrogen charged specimen by 75% compared to an untreated one.","2012-03","2019-05-17 18:40:29","2019-05-17 18:40:29","2019-05-17 18:40:29","5268-5276","","6","37","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\mapaqr\Zotero\storage\ATWDRAHU\Takakuwa et Soyama - 2012 - Suppression of hydrogen-assisted fatigue crack gro.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, duralumin plates containing holes with rounded edges with a radius of 0.5 mm were treated by cavitation peening (CP) and shot peening (SP). Fatigue tests under uniaxial tensile loading were carried out to obtain the lifetime versus applied stress curves, i.e., the S-N curves. Then, the fractured surfaces were examined using SEM. Also, a combination of residual stress measurements with electro-chemical polishing was carried out to evaluate the compressive residual stress proﬁle with respect to the depth into the wall surrounding the hole. The results showed that the lifetime of the CP specimen was almost 25 times larger than that of the as-machined one. The fatigue strength, also, was increased by 18% by cavitation peening. In contrast, shot peening reduced the lifetime, since this caused the formation of a roll over layer at the rounded edges, from which cracks due to high stress can initiate. The effect on the fatigue strength of a plate with a hole can be explained on the basis of whether or not roll over occurs and on the residual stress proﬁle with respect to the depth from the surface surrounding the hole.","2016-12","2019-05-17 18:40:31","2019-05-17 18:40:31","2019-05-17 18:40:31","200-205","","","307","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\mapaqr\Zotero\storage\ZPSI89WK\Takakuwa et al. - 2016 - Using cavitation peening to enhance the fatigue st.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is used extensively in the aerospace industry where weight and fatigue are key issues. During the manufacturing and service life of a component, a peened surface might get scratched or slightly damaged. In this case, re-peening is necessary to restore the compressive residual stress layer after removal of the damage area. When repeening is necessary, rotary flap peening, also known as flapper peening, is often used because it is quick, clean and cost effective.","","2019-05-17 18:40:34","2019-05-17 18:40:34","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\mapaqr\Zotero\storage\L6TW76PN\Forgues et al. - Controlled Rotary Flap Peening for Repair Applicat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fatigue limits of welded specimens containing a semi-circular slit were increased for the peened specimens. Peened specimens with slit sizes of a = 1.0 mm had high fatigue limits that were nearly equal to those of non-slit, peened specimens. We observed that a semicircular slit with a depth of less than a = 1.0 mm could be rendered harmless by peening. Additionally, the values of fatigue limit and the maximum depth of a semi-circular slit that can be rendered harmless by peening were predicted based on fracture mechanics, where we assume that a semi-circular slit is equivalent to a semi-circular crack.

Residual stress","","","","","Fine Particle Shot Peening (FPSP), which has been developed in the Japanese automobile industry for steel parts, enables to improve fatigue property much more than the conventional Shot Peening (SP). The suitable FPSP process for the aluminum aircraft parts is under development. Fatigue life of conventional shot peened 7050T7451 aluminum parts was increased by several times, while that of fine particle shot peened aluminum was increased by more than ten times compared with that of as machined. Compressive residual stress on fine particle shot peened surface which was covered with uniform dimples adequately is higher than that on shot peened surface. Fracture surface observation revealed that the fatigue crack of fine particle shot peened samples originate at the subsurface layer, which shows the high compressive residual stress at very near the surface and less roughened surface prevent crack initiation from the surface. Then FPSP can improve fatigue life farther more than SP does, which shows fatigue crack initiates from a small flaws and laps on the surface created by SP.","","2019-05-17 18:40:37","2019-05-17 18:40:37","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\mapaqr\Zotero\storage\VCU9KPXX\Inoue et al. - Fatigue property enhancement by Fine Particle Shot.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of the FPP treatment on gas nitriding behavior and consequent fatigue properties of AISI 316 steel were evaluated. Surface microstructures of the FPP treated specimens prior to gas nitriding were characterized using a micro-Vickers hardness tester, scanning electron microscope (SEM), optical microscope, electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The FPP treatment generated a local stratiﬁcation pattern which exhibits high dislocation densities. During the subsequent nitriding process, nitrogen diffused into this unique structure, resulting in an increase in the surface hardness. Fatigue tests on a number of specimens with differing surface treatments were performed at room temperature using a rotational bending fatigue testing machine. The FPP treated specimen prior to gas nitriding exhibited the highest fatigue strength. After the fatigue tests, fracture surfaces were observed using an SEM in order to investigate the high-cycle fatigue properties.","2010-02","2019-05-17 18:40:38","2019-05-17 18:40:39","2019-05-17 18:40:38","403-410","","2","32","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\mapaqr\Zotero\storage\J4KXN8PF\Kikuchi et al. - 2010 - Fatigue properties of gas nitrided austenitic stai.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, the structural deterioration due to local buckling of a steel member is implemented in constitutive relationship. The approach inevitably leads to the constitutive relationship of softening type, which however does not readily yield mesh objective result. The present study proposes a finite element procedure to overcome the problem: in a local-buckling zone, average state variables instead of local state variables are used. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure is verified by solving example problems. Moreover, the applicability of a simple trilinear type of constitutive relationship associated with the proposed beam-element analysis is investigated in comparison with shell-element analysis by ABAQUS.","","2019-05-17 18:40:40","2019-05-17 18:40:40","","147","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\mapaqr\Zotero\storage\G6EMYZLC\Ho - The Hong Kong Polyt.

Comprehensive evaluation of the surface integrity is therefore crucial for surfaces of load bearing components where fatigue life is a concern. The novel treatment involves submerging a work piece within a vibratory chamber filled with hardened stainless steel media, analogous to the mass finishing process. During the treatment, the work piece’s surface is peened and polished simultaneously through the normal and shear stresses generated by impacts between the work piece and steel media. The surface integrity generated by this treatment is intimately related to the processing parameters. This work focuses on measurements of residual stresses and cold work distribution in the nearsurface layers as well as surface topography generated at different stages of processing. Such measurements allow for process optimisation as well as a better understanding on the contribution of the different aspects of surface integrity to mechanical performance, particularly fatigue.","2017-01-15","2019-06-11 20:06:14","2019-06-11 20:06:15","2019-06-11 20:06:14","311-316","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\mapaqr\Zotero\storage\E6SBGH8V\2017 - Investigations of the Residual Stresses and Surfac.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Residual Stresses 10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
