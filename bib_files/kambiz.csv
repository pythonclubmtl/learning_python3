Applications for both stretchable and self-healing materials include, but are not limited to, electronics, displays, energy, the environment, and medicine. While the majority of organic materials can generally be rendered flexible, such materials are not stretchable, which is a key mechanical property necessary to realize applications of E-skin for prosthetics, artificial intelligence, systems for robotics, personal health monitoring, biocompatibility, and communication devices. In our effort to survey materials utilized in various components of an electronic device, we report herein recent advances in stretchable and self-healing conductors, semiconductors, and substrates. We highlight some key technologies recently developed in stretchable organic-based sensors, solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and self-healing electronic devices.","2013","2019-06-11 15:43:05","2019-06-11 15:43:05","","1961-1977","","12","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Stretchable electronics Self-healing Electronic skin PDMS Stretchable conductors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe the dominant mechanisms for the transport of small molecules in polymers and polymer nanocomposites, as well as the procedures for the measurement of the permeability and the diffusivity. The emphasis is given on the various models that have been proposed for the prediction of permeability in polymer–clay nanocomposites. The influence of the characteristics of the inorganic particles on the barrier properties of the composite membrane is discussed and tested using the model and the available experimental data. Some aspects on the methods of improving the barrier properties of the nanocomposite are examined and a few applications of these materials as gas barriers are presented.","2009","2019-06-11 15:43:06","2019-06-11 15:43:06","","967-984","","4","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Gas permeability Barrier properties Permeation models Nano-clay Nanocomposite","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Effects of structure and physical properties of the compatibilizers on the clay dispersion and clay amount on the microstructure and physical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated. The OxPE was shown to significantly create interfacial interactions between the polymer phase and clay layers. Rheological behavior of the samples was examined by a dynamic oscillatory rheometry in linear viscoelastic region. Percolation threshold (ϕp) and corresponding aspect ratio (Af) values were determined by analyzing the improvement in storage modulus at low frequency region depending on the clay loading. Lower percolation and higher aspect ratio values were obtained for the sample series prepared with the PE-g-MA than that prepared with the OxPE. Moreover, fractal size of the clay network above the percolation point was determined by the scaling law for physical gelation of colloidal flocks to quantify clay dispersion depending on the compatibilizer structure. It was found that the PE-g-MA yielded better clay dispersion and more exfoliated structure compared to the OxPE. Microstructural characterization of the samples was also characterized by XRD and TEM.","2007","2019-06-11 15:43:08","2019-06-11 15:43:08","","4492-4502","","15","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Polyethylene nanocomposite Oxidized polyethylene Rheology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we report that thin films of hard electronic materials patterned in deterministic fractal motifs and bonded to elastomers enable unusual mechanics with important implications in stretchable device design. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of Peano, Greek cross, Vicsek and other fractal constructs to yield space-filling structures of electronic materials, including monocrystalline silicon, for electrophysiological sensors, precision monitors and actuators, and radio frequency antennas. These devices support conformal mounting on the skin and have unique properties such as invisibility under magnetic resonance imaging.

A controllable growth of aligned CNx nanotubes was achieved by simple CVD in a temperature range of 700-950 [degree]C leading to nitrogen doping from 12.1 to 25.7 at%. The highest doping level was achieved at 850 [degree]C, which is attributed to the abundance of C-N fragments at this decomposition temperature. Nitrogen doping level and the type of N-moieties were determined by XPS and EELS analyses. HRTEM analysis suggests that N-substituted graphitic units (gN) give rise to fullerenic curvature into the cylindrical graphite layers (leading to curled side-wall morphology), whereas pyridinic units (pN) break the graphitic continuity (leading to dangling bonds on the side walls). It is observed that the abundance of N-substituted graphitic units (gN) enhances the electrical conductivity of individual nanotubes by donating additional electrons to the CNT network. The field emission (FE) characteristics show that the increase of N doping from 19.6 at% to 25.7 at% effectively reduces the turn-on field (for 10 [small micro]A cm-2) from 1.92 V [small micro]m-1 to 0.88 V [small micro]m-1, whereas the threshold field (for 10 mA cm-2) decreases from 4.05 V [small micro]m-1 to 2.32 V [small micro]m-1. However, at high growth temperature (950 [degree]C), the N-doping level decreases to 12.1 at%, thereby degrading the FE performance.","2010","2019-06-11 15:43:10","2019-06-11 15:43:10","","4128-4134","","20","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Six organoclays were synthesised by replacing the interlayer inorganic cations, initially present, with quaternary phosphonium and ammonium surfactant cations. The samples modified with tetrabutylphosphonium (TBP), and butyltriphenylphosphonium (BTPP) ions have an appreciably higher thermal stability than the octadecyltrimethylammonium (ODTMA)-modified clays. Thus, in the case of TBP- and BTPP-modified montmorillonites, the onset temperature of decomposition is close to 300 °C. Samples modified with hexadecyltributylphosphonium (HDTBP) ions have a lower onset temperature of decomposition of 225 °C. In comparison, the onset temperature for ODTMA-montmorillonites (obtained at different concentrations of ODTMA-bromide) ranges from 158 to 222 °C, being highest where the concentration of intercalated surfactant is lowest. The onset temperature for a commercial alkylsilane-treated quaternary ammonium-modified organoclay (S-BEN N-400FP) is 207 °C. The basal spacing of the TBP- and BTPP-modified clays is 1.7–1.8 nm, indicating a monolayer arrangement of quaternary phosphonium ions in the interlayer space, while the value of 2.5 nm for HDTBP-montmorillonite indicates a more open structure. The ODTMA-modified samples have basal spacings ranging from 1.9 to 2.1 nm, indicative of a bilayer to pseudo-trilayer arrangement. The exceptionally high basal spacing of 3.4 nm for the S-BEN N-400FP organoclay might be due to interlayer penetration of organosilane hydrolysis products during synthesis.

Catalyst mediated CVD growth is very well suited for selective, in-situ growth of nanotubes compatible with the requirements of microelectronics technology. This deposition method can be exploited for carbon nanotube vias. Semiconducting single-walled tubes can be successfully operated as carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs). A simulation of an ideal vertical CNTFET is presented and compared with the requirements of the ITRS roadmap.

Plasmonic welding, which was done at the junctions of AgNWs in order to form hybrid AgNW/SWCNT conductors on an Ecoflex substrate, enabled excellent electrical and mechanical stability under large tensile strains of over 480% without the need to pre-strain. Furthermore, we demonstrate highly stretchable circuits that are used to power LED arrays.

Paraffin was added to decrease the percolation threshold of electric conductivity. LLDPE–paraffin/xGnP nanocomposites were prepared by separate solution and total solution mixing methods. The mixture master batch of each mixing method was injection-molded to produce composites with a mini twin-screw extruder. The separate mixing method was not suitable since there was not enough electrical conductivity due to the low xGnP content in the nanocomposites. However, paraffin does not affect mechanical properties until around 30 wt% of content has been added, even though the content is low molecular weight polyethylene. When the total mixing method was used, the adding content of xGnP and paraffin was easily controlled. Five weight percentage of xGnP loaded nanocomposite showed electrical conductivity when 10 wt% of paraffin was added. From the results of SEM images of fracture surface and DSC, it could be seen that Paraffin was well coated on xGnP, resulting in a separate phase between xGnP and LLDPE. By coating paraffin on xGnP in the LLDPE matrix, the percolation threshold dramatically decreased compared to the xGnP–LLDPE nanocomposite.","2010","2019-06-11 15:43:15","2019-06-11 15:43:15","","581-587","","5","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","A.

The oxidation is carried out by refluxing the as-received MWNT in concentrated HNO3 and H2O2/NH4OH solutions, respectively, under several different treatment conditions. The oxidized MWNT are negatively charged and functionalized with carboxylic groups by both solutions. The MWNT oxidized under severe conditions are well purified, but their crystalline structures are partially damaged. It is recognized that the damage to the MWNT has considerable influence on the electrical properties of the MWNT composites, causing the electrical conductivity to be lowered at a low content of MWNT and the percolation threshold to be raised. The MWNT oxidized by the mixture of H2O2 and NH4OH solution provides epoxy composites with a higher conductivity than those produced with the MWNT oxidized by nitric acid over the whole range of MWNT, independently of the oxidation conditions.","2005","2019-06-11 15:43:15","2019-06-11 15:43:15","","23-30","","1","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","A.

A few weight percent loading of organoclay in nylon 6 boosts the heat distortion temperature by 80°C, making possible structural applications under conditions where the pristine polymer would normally fail. A similar loading of clay nanolayers in elastomeric epoxy and polyurethane matrices dramatically improves both the toughness and the tensile properties of these thermoset systems. Glassy epoxy nanocomposites exhibit substantial improvement in yield strength and modulus under compressive stress–strain conditions. The latest development in polypropylene hybrids have yielded nanocomposites with improved storage moduli. Polyimide hybrids in thin-film form display a 10-fold decrease in permeability toward water vapor at 2 wt.% clay loading. In situ and melt intercalation processing methods are effective in producing reinforced polystyrene hybrids. Nitrile rubber hybrids show improved storage moduli and reduced permeabilities even toward gases as small as hydrogen. Poly(ε-caprolactone)–clay nanocomposites prepared by in situ polymerization of ε-caprolactone in organoclay galleries show a substantial reduction in water adsorption. Polysiloxane nanocomposites produced from poly(dimethylsiloxane) and organoclay mixtures have improved in tensile properties, thermal stability and resistance to swelling solvents. Organoclay-poly(l-lactide) composite film was obtained by solvent casting technique. Clay nanolayers dispersed in liquid crystals act as structure directors and form hybrids composites that can be switched from being highly opaque to highly transparent by applying an electric field of short duration.","1999","2019-06-11 15:43:17","2019-06-11 15:43:17","","11-29","","1–2","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","polymers silicates nanocomposites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Improved imaging with computerised tomography (CT) has been followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, more recently, it has become possible to reformat the data as three-dimensional images. Computer technology has new moved forward with the advent of rapid prototyping techniques (RPT) which allow both the production of models of the hard tissues and custom-made prostheses from computerised scanning data.

The LLDPE/CNT fibers were produced by melt extrusion process using a twin-screw extruder, in a controlled temperature from 160 °C to 275 °C. Further, melt extrusion process was followed by drawing of fibers at the room temperature. Three different weight percentages, 0.08, 0.3 and 1 wt.% of CNT were studied for producing nanocomposite fibers. The addition of 1 wt.% CNT in the LLDPE fiber has increased the tensile strength by 38% (350 MPa). The addition of 0.08 and 0.3 wt.% CNT in the fiber matrix has improved the ductility by 87% and 122%, respectively. Similarly, improvement in the toughness was observed by 63% and 105% for LLDPE fibers with 0.08 wt.% and 0.3 wt.% CNT respectively. The increase in the mechanical properties of the composite fibers was attributed to the alignment and distribution of CNT in the LLDPE matrix. The dispersion of CNT in the polymeric matrix has been revealed by SEM. The study shows that the small addition of CNT when properly mixed and aligned will increase the mechanical properties of pristine polymer fibers.","2011","2019-06-11 15:43:19","2019-06-11 15:43:19","","3633-3635","","23–24","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbon nanotubes Polymeric composites Fiber technology Nanocomposites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To determine how web mechanics are controlled by their topological design and material distribution, here we create spider-web mimics composed of elastomeric filaments. Specifically, computational modelling and microscale 3D printing are combined to investigate the mechanical response of elastomeric webs under multiple loading conditions. We find the existence of an asymptotic prey size that leads to a saturated web strength. We identify pathways to design elastomeric material structures with maximum strength, low density and adaptability. We show that the loading type dictates the optimal material distribution, that is, a homogeneous distribution is better for localized loading, while stronger radial threads with weaker spiral threads is better for distributed loading. Our observations reveal that the material distribution within spider webs is dictated by the loading condition, shedding light on their observed architectural variations.","2015","2019-06-11 15:43:21","2019-06-11 15:43:21","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Helical microtubules of graphitic carbon Nature. 1991; 354:56–8), carbon nanotubes have been the focus of considerable research. Numerous investigators have since reported remarkable physical and mechanical properties for this new form of carbon. From unique electronic properties and a thermal conductivity higher than diamond to mechanical properties where the stiffness, strength and resilience exceeds any current material, carbon nanotubes offer tremendous opportunities for the development of fundamentally new material systems. In particular, the exceptional mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes, combined with their low density, offer scope for the development of nanotube-reinforced composite materials. The potential for nanocomposites reinforced with carbon tubes having extraordinary specific stiffness and strength represent tremendous opportunity for application in the 21st century. This paper provides a concise review of recent advances in carbon nanotubes and their composites.

According to the analyses of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, adsorption heat and nitrogen adsorption isotherms, the strong interaction between hydrogen molecules and the Li-doped CNTs, as well as the better charge isolation state of Li, may contribute to the improved hydrogen storage capacity. However, excessive Li may result in a lowering of the charge isolation state and a decrease in specific surface area and pore volume, and thus deteriorate the hydrogen storage capacity.","2010","2019-06-11 15:43:25","2019-06-11 15:43:25","","6490-6494","","31","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stacking of individual two-dimensional MGPs is effectively inhibited by introducing one-dimensional MWCNTs. Long and tortuous MWCNTs can bridge adjacent MGPs and inhibit their aggregation, resulting in a high contact area between the MGP/MWCNT structures and the polymer matrix. Scanning electron microscope images of the fracture surfaces of the epoxy matrix showed that MWCNT/MGP hybrid nanofillers exhibited higher solubility and better compatibility than individual MWCNTs and MGPs did. The tensile strength of GD400-MWCNT/MGP/epoxy composites was 35.4% higher than that of the epoxy alone, compared to only a 0.9% increase in tensile strength for MGP/epoxy composites over the epoxy compound. Thermal conductivity increased by 146.9% using GD400-MWCNT/MGP hybrid fillers and 23.9% for MGP fillers, compared to non-derivatised epoxy.","2011","2019-06-11 15:43:26","2019-06-11 15:43:26","","793-803","","3","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concentration of methanol in the fuel circulation loop of a DMFC system is an important operating parameter, because it determines the electrical performance and efficiency of the system. The methanol concentration in the circulating fuel stream is usually measured continuously with a suitable sensor for the purpose of maintaining optimal power and efficiency in the DMFC system. Various methods of sensing methanol concentration have been proposed over the past decade. This paper reviews these methanol concentration sensors for DMFCs, which are generally classified into two groups: electrochemical and physical. The construction and operating principles of each sensor, as well as its advantages and disadvantages, are described. The sensorless methods for controlling the methanol concentration are introduced briefly. Finally, the perspective on the future of methanol concentration sensors is discussed.","2006","2019-06-11 15:43:27","2019-06-11 15:43:27","","626-636","","1","159","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Direct methanol fuel cell Methanol concentration sensor Oxidation current Density Dielectric constant Viscosity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
