abstract = {The influence of voids in the initiation and propagation of static flexural and flexural fatigue failures of unidirectional carbon fibre composite was investigated. Vacuum pressure in the vacuum bag oven cure process was varied to produce void levels in the range 0.5-6{\%}. The voids were characterised using image analysis and used to explain the static flexural strengths and flexural fatigue results. It was observed that mean void content and aspect ratios were less effective in explaining the mechanical property results than void size distributions. A strong correlation between large voids (area {\textgreater} 0.03 mm2) and a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties was found. This was attributed to the effect of these voids on the crack propagation in the resin rich inter-ply regions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

An in-depth study on the $\backslash$r$\backslash$noscillatory and transient rheological behavior of prepreg composites is conducted using a $\backslash$r$\backslash$ndynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) and the study $\backslash$r$\backslash$nof cure kinetics $\backslash$r$\backslash$nis conducted using $\backslash$r$\backslash$na $\backslash$r$\backslash$ndifferential scanning calorimet$\backslash$r$\backslash$ner (DSC). A novel experimental methodology $\backslash$r$\backslash$nis proposed in this $\backslash$r$\backslash$nstudy to describe the stress relaxation behavior of prepreg composites during cure. Time- and $\backslash$r$\backslash$ncure-dependent stress relaxation behavior of prepreg composites is studied in three in-plane $\backslash$r$\backslash$ndirections: 0, 45, and 90 degrees of the laminates. Several other factors, such as the mismatch of $\backslash$r$\backslash$nfiber orientation of adjoining plies, stacking sequence of the laminate, and relative position of the $\backslash$r$\backslash$nplies with respect to the neutral axis are considered to study their effects on the stress relaxation $\backslash$r$\backslash$nbehavior during cure. The stress relaxation behavior of cured composites is obtained by utilizing $\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe time-temperature superposition (TTS) principle. $\backslash$r$\backslash$nTTS study on UD laminates (in 0, 45, and $\backslash$r$\backslash$n90 degree fiber directions) is conducted at four distinct cure states, whereas the PW laminate $\backslash$r$\backslash$nis $\backslash$r$\backslash$nstudied in the same fiber directions but at a fully cured state only. Experimental results are used $\backslash$r$\backslash$nto predict the life cycle of the composite products by generating the stress relaxation master $\backslash$r$\backslash$ncurves for different combinations of fiber orientation and cure states$\backslash$r$\backslash$n. $\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe study shows that the relaxation modulus during cure is case dependent, which leads $\backslash$r$\backslash$nto the assumption that the relaxation of process-induced stress$\backslash$r$\backslash$nes during cure varies for different $\backslash$r$\backslash$nconditions. Moreover, when $\backslash$r$\backslash$ncomparing the performance of UD and PW prepregs, it shows that $\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe PW laminate relaxes more residual stress than the UD laminate during cure.

abstract = {This papers aims to characterize the influence of moisture uptake on the mechanical behaviour of unidirectional flax fibre-reinforced epoxy laminates. Monotonic and cyclic tensile tests and free vibration characterization are carried out. Results show that UD flax-epoxy composites, when exposed to hygrothermal conditioning at 70 °C and 85{\%} RH, exhibit a diffusion kinetic which follows a one dimensional Fickian behaviour. The mass uptake at equilibrium is approximately 3.3{\%} and the diffusion coefficient 6.5 × 10-6m2s-1. Water vapour sorption is shown to induce a significant change in the shape of the tensile stress-strain curve, a decrease in the dynamic elastic modulus of about 20{\%} and a 50{\%} increase in the damping ratio. Contrary to all expectations, water saturation does not degrade the monotonic tensile strength of such a flax-epoxy composites and leads to an increase in the fatigue strength for a high number of cycles.},

abstract = {Preliminary notes Laminated composites have an important application in modern aeronautical structures. They have extraordinary properties, like high strength, stiffness and lightweight. Nevertheless, a serious obstacle to more widespread use of those materials is their sensitivity to impact loads. As a consequence of that, impact damage initiation and growth are appearing in them. Failures that occur in laminated composite structures can be intralaminar and interlaminar. To date a lot of models for impact damages in laminates have been developed with higher or lower accuracy. Those models can replace real and expensive testing in laminated structures with some approximation. By using specialized software the damage parameters in laminate aircraft structures can be predicted (at certain conditions). In that way numerical simulation of impact on certain laminates can be done and the obtained results from the simulations presented in a form of graphic damage distributions.

The preparation of composites samples with porosity, control, and measurement of void content, and moisture absorption behavior of carbon/epoxy laminates are discussed. Rheological analyses are used to characterize the viscosity behavior of prepregs either in the presence or absence of moisture. Polymeric composites with different levels of voids were produced and submitted to hygrothermal conditioning to study the moisture absorption behavior. It was found that the rate of water uptake and the maximum level of moisture absorption in carbon/epoxy composites depends on the void content and specimen geometry. The dependence on the void content may be quite significant. The nature of the matrix system was also verified to affect the moisture absorption properties of the composite.},

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using an embedded-atom (EAM) potential for copper have been performed at room temperature and using strain controlling with high strain rates ranging from 10{\^{}}7/sec to 10{\^{}}10/sec. Strain-rates of these magnitudes can be studied experimentally, e.g. using shock waves induced by laser ablation. Void growth has been simulated in three different conditions, namely uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial expansion. The response of the system in the three cases have been compared in terms of the void growth rate, the detailed void shape evolution, and the stress-strain behavior including the development of plastic strain. Also macroscopic observables as plastic work and porosity have been computed from the atomistic level. The stress thresholds for void growth are found to be comparable with spall strength values determined by dynamic fracture experiments. The conventional macroscopic assumption that the mean plastic strain results from the growth of the void is validated. The evolution of the system in the uniaxial case is found to exhibit four different regimes: elastic expansion; plastic yielding, when the mean stress is nearly constant, but the stress-triaxiality increases rapidly together with exponential growth of the void; saturation of the stress-triaxiality; and finally the failure.},

The simulations used geometries identical to those of the experiments and incorporated ductile damage by element removal under the control of a ductile damage indicator based on the micromechanical studies of Rice and Tracey. A regularization of the problem was achieved through an integral-type nonlocal model based on the smoothing of the rate of a damage indicator D over a characteristic length L. The simulation does not predict the experimentally observed damage acceleration either in the case where no damage is included or when only a local damage model is used. However, the full three-dimensional simulations based on the nonlocal damage methodology do predict both the failure path and the failure strain at void linkage for almost all configurations studied. For the cases considered the critical parameter controlling the local deformations at void linkage was found to be the ratio between hole diameter and hole spacing.},

abstract = {In recent decades, nanoindentation has emerged as a useful experimental technique for characterising the in situ properties of fibrous composite constituents. However, the elastic theory used by the nanoindentation technique assumes that the substrate is a stress-free single-phase homogeneous continuum. Therefore, the application of nanoindentation theory to inhomogeneous composite materials composed of discrete regions with distinct material properties has proven to be problematic in certain scenarios. In this paper, a review of the key developments and pertinent issues reported by authors in relation to the nanoindentation of polymer matrix composites is presented. The effects of sample preparation, neighbouring constituents, residual stress, pile-up, time-dependent deformation and hydrostatic stress on the important nanoindentation parameters and properties are highlighted. The review also details the use of numerical simulations to gain greater insight into the stress and deformation fields produced during the nanoindentation of FRP microstructures, and includes recommendations regarding the standardisation of nanoindentation protocols for composite and polymeric materials.},

To compute stress for given strain, a finite element model of a three-phased unit cell with the hexagonal symmetry was employed. Mixed mode debonding conditions between reinforcement and matrix were modeled by a bilinear cohesive law. A stress transfer between matrix and fiber was simulated by a inhomogeneous interphase. A detailed analysis of a debonding growth was also presented. Parametrical studies showed that a choice of values for cohesive parameters as well as debonding locations do have an influence on the macroscopic response of material. An ability of the proposed model to simulate the softening behavior of the material under transverse tension and to predict final failure was demonstrated. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A micromechanics damage model is presented which examines the effect of fibre-matrix debonding and thermal residual stress on the transverse damage behaviour of a unidirectional carbon fibre reinforced epoxy composite. It is found that for a weak fibre-matrix interface, the presence of thermal residual stress can induce damage prior to mechanical loading. However, for a strong fibre-matrix interface the presence of thermal residual stress is effective in suppressing fibre-matrix debonding and improving overall transverse strength by approximately 7{\%}. The micromechanical model is subjected to a multiple loading cycle (i.e. tension-compression-tension), where it is shown to provide novel insight into the microscopic damage accumulation that forms prior to ultimate failure, clearly highlighting the different roles that fibre-matrix debonding and matrix plasticity play in forming the macroscopic response of the composite. Such information is vital to the development of accurate continuum damage models, which often smear these effects using non-physical material parameters. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Evolution of cracks and microcracks could induce catastrophic material failure. Therefore, the detection/diagnostics and effective repair of cracks and microcracks are vital for ensuring the performance reliability, cost effectiveness and safety for polymer structures. Cracks and microcracks, however, are difficult to detect and often repair processes are complex. Biologically inspired self-healing polymer systems with inherent ability to repair damage have the potential to autonomically repair cracks and microcracks. This article is a review on the latest developments on the topics of cracks and microcracks initiation and propagation in polymer structures and it discusses the current techniques for detection and observation. Furthermore, cracks and microcrack repair through bio-mimetic self-healing techniques is discussed along with surface active protection. A separate section is dedicated to fracture analysis and discusses in details fracture mechanics and formation.},

abstract = {Dynamic crack propagation drives catastrophic solid failures. In many amorphous brittle materials, sufficiently fast crack growth involves small-scale, high-frequency microcracking damage localized near the crack tip. The ultrafast dynamics of microcrack nucleation, growth, and coalescence is inaccessible experimentally and fast crack propagation was therefore studied only as a macroscale average. Here, we overcome this limitation in polymethylmethacrylate, the archetype of brittle amorphous materials: We reconstruct the complete spatiotemporal microcracking dynamics, with micrometer/nanosecond resolution, through post mortem analysis of the fracture surfaces. We find that all individual microcracks propagate at the same low, load-independent velocity. Collectively, the main effect of microcracks is not to slow down fracture by increasing the energy required for crack propagation, as commonly believed, but on the contrary to boost the macroscale velocity through an acceleration factor selected on geometric grounds. Our results emphasize the key role of damage-related internal variables in the selection of macroscale fracture dynamics.},

The synergistic damaging components featuring LEO environment are high vacuum, thermal cycling, neutral gas, ultraviolet (UV) radiation and cold plasma. The synergistic effects due to these environmental elements are simulated by "on ground" tests, performed in the Space Environment Simulator (SAS) at the University of Rome "La Sapienza"; numerical simulations are performed by the Space Environment Information System (SPENVIS), developed by the European Space Agency (ESA). A "safe life" design for a solar array primary structure is developed, taking into consideration the combined damaging action of the LEO environment components; therefore results from both numerical and experimental simulations are coupled within the framework of a standard finite element method (FEM) based design. The expected durability of the solar array primary structure, made of laminated sandwich composite, is evaluated assuming that the loads exerted on the structure itself are essentially dependent on thermo-elastic stresses. The optical degradation of surface materials and the stiffness and strength degradation of structural elements are taken into account to assess the global structural durability of the solar array under characteristic operative conditions in LEO environment. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The material responses were characterized through an assessment of the physical, thermal and mechanical property changes. It follows from the experimental results presented that the synergistic actions of the vacuum and the thermal cycling on the composite property degradation can be attributed to the formation of microvoids and interfacial sliding at the fiber-matrix interface in the early stages of cycling.

A systematic consideration has been made of the symmetries present in idealized fibre-matrix systems. The symmetries enable the stresses, strains and displacements to be mapped from a unit cell to the whole field of interest. Appropriate boundary conditions of the unit cell have been derived from these symmetry considerations for micromechanical analyses. The loads on the unit cell, and the responses of it in terms of macroscopic stresses or strains, have been addressed in such a way that the effective properties of the material can be obtained from micromechanical analyses of the unit cell in a standard manner. No systematic account of this kind is available in the literature, while the use of the unit cell for analyses of the microscopic behaviour of composite materials is becoming popular, in particular using finite elements, in order to obtain in-depth understanding of the performance of these materials. Ineffective introductions of the unit cell and incorrect applications of boundary conditions are often encountered. These have been clarified in this paper so that correct and effective use of the unit cell for micromechanical analyses can be achieved. {\textcopyright} 1999 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to characterize and compare damage processes in carbon/epoxy laminates submitted to either isothermal ageing or thermal cycling in neutral (vacuum or nitrogen) and oxidative (air) atmospheres. During a thermal cycling test performed in an oxidative atmosphere like air, there is a coupling effect between matrix oxidation, occurring at the highest temperatures of the cycle, and matrix cracking due to thermo-mechanical ply stresses induced by the prevented differential expansions of the plies. In order to separate those two damage mechanisms, a model of oxidation is used to determine the experimental conditions of an isothermal test 'equivalent' to a thermal cycling one, in terms of mass loss due to oxidation. After having checked this equivalence, a quantitative analysis of the damages induced by the two types of tests, is carried out. It is shown that the oxidation of a laminate in isothermal conditions results in damages, which concern only the skin of the sample. On the contrary, the coupling of such damage mechanisms with cyclic stresses in thermal cycling accelerates the damage processes and especially the matrix crack propagation from the surfaces to the core of the laminate. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The first two parts were dedicated to the formation of thermal residual stresses and experimental techniques to detect these stresses, respectively. This third paper discusses the effects that thermal residual stresses have on the material properties of thermoplastic composites. Composite laminates as well as composite structures were considered. Residual stresses were found to affect the composites' matrix-dominated, mechanical and durability properties, as well as to inflict damage and dimensional instability. Several mechanisms to relieve thermal residual stresses are proposed. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Fiber/matrix interface debond growth is one of the main mechanisms of damage evolution in unidirectional (UD) polymer composites. Because for polymer composites the fiber strain to failure is smaller than for the matrix multiple fiber breaks occur at random positions when high mechanical stress is applied to the composite. The energy released due to each fiber break is usually larger than necessary for the creation of a fiber break therefore a partial debonding of fiber/matrix interface is typically observed. Thus the stiffness reduction of UD composite is contributed both from the fiber breaks and from the interface debonds. The aim of this paper is to analyze the debond growth in carbon fiber/epoxy and glass fiber/epoxy UD composites using fracture mechanics principles by calculation of energy release rate G II . A 3-D FEM model is developed for calculation of energy release rate for fiber/matrix interface debonds at different locations in the composite including the composite surface region where the stress state differs from the one in the bulk composite. In the model individual partially debonded fiber is surrounded by matrix region and embedded in a homogenized composite.},

abstract = {In this paper, two models are presented for plain weave composites. One is finite element analysis (FEA) model for elastic constants, namely, sinusoidal yarn model. Another is analytical model for failure strengths, namely, sinusoidal beam model. The FEA model is generated by interfacing an in-house computer code with FEA software strand6, and the analytical model is developed using the theory of elasticity. Numerical studies are carried out using the present models to investigate the effects of some major geometrical parameters on the properties of plain weave composites. It is concluded that the failure strengths are closely related to the fiber volume fraction of a yarn, and the mechanical properties are closely related to the overall fiber volume fraction of the composites. An experimental testing program is conducted for T300/934 plain weave composites to validate the developed models. A good agreement exists between the predicted and measured results.

abstract = {With the boom of the information age, the doors to novel techniques and more intensive computational processes have opened wide. What yesterday was impossible to achieve, today is becoming a reality. Concepts such as multiscale modelling, merging the worlds of macro- and micromechanics, are establishing themselves as viable alternatives to experimental procedures in the characterisation of the mechanical behaviour of complex materials. Advanced composite materials are a perfect field for application of such modelling concepts. At themicro-scale level, composites exhibit two distinct phases – the fibrous reinforcements and the matrix resin. The fibres provide strength and stiffness while the matrix gives lateral support to the fibres. Micromechanics provides the means to analyse the constitutive behaviour of each of these constituents and study the influence of each one in the overall mechanical properties of the composite. This thesis provides new tools for the micromechanical study of com- posite materials. An algorithm to generate a random distribution of fibres with a high fibre volume fraction is developed. The algorithm is statistically verified for the randomness of its results. The generated distributions are used to develop representative volume elements of real composite materials at the micro-scale. The concept of periodic boundary conditions is applied throughout the thesis. This type of boundary conditions forces the continuity of thematerial in opposite faces of the representative volume element, as well as the conti- nuity of the displacement field. Results from the micromechanical analyses are submitted to volumetric homogenisation to obtain the macromechanical behaviour of the homogenised composite. A constitutive damage model has been developed for each constituent of the composite. A plasticity model is implemented to simulate themechanical behaviour of the matrix, based on available experimental evidence. The plasticity model considers pressure dependency and different yield strengths in tension and compression. Both constituents follow damage evolution laws developed in the framework of thermodynamics of admissible processes. The implemented damage laws do not suffer from mesh dependency. Both constitutive models were implemented in a commercial finite ele- ment software. The algorithms for generation of random distributions and application of periodic boundary conditions, as well as for post-processing results were all implemented in a package of scripts which provides the pos- sibility to execute all required operations in a sequential and automatic way without the need for user intervention. Two applications of these methodologies are presented. The first in- volves the use of the implemented subroutines to plot failure envelopes of a uniaxial composite under different loading conditions. Results from the micromechanical modelling are compared with the results of an analytical failure criterion recently proposed for composite materials. The constitutive damage models developed are also applied to textile composites. A 5-harness satin wet weave is modelled using CAD software and a representative unit-cell of the material is generated. The yarns are modelled using a transversely isotropic damage law while the matrix is con- sidered to follow the elasto-plastic with damage constitutive law developed in this thesis. Different loading conditions are applied and the evolution of damage obtained from numerical analysis is compared with experimental information available in the literature.},

abstract = {Epoxy carbon-fibre prepreg, Hexcel Type 6376 HTS, was investigated using Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA). The DMA characteristic parameters are storage modulus E???, loss modulus E??? and loss factor tan??. These parameters are ideally suited to observe the vitrification, referred to as glass transition, resulting from the cross-linking reaction. Detection of the cure state may also be achieved by determining the momentary glass transition temperature of partially cured samples. The consequent use of a multi-frequency measuring regime was used to derive the apparent activation energy for the glass transition process. Different temperature programs were also applied to monitor the curing process directly, as well as to investigate the different states of incomplete cure reached in preceding curing steps. The intention was to provide better understanding of the consequences of an interrupted autoclave curing process and to use DMA to detect the cure state achieved. With DMA, the continuation of an incomplete curing process also can be monitored. DMA measurements up to 300 ??C showed, furthermore, that the final glass transition temperature was reduced by thermal degradation at high temperatures.},

For both materials, room temperature stress-strain curves and transverse thermal conductivity-strain curves are available from a previous experimental investigation; these curves have been used as benchmarks to assess the fidelity of the models. The tow model has first been used to develop relationships for 0 degrees/90 degrees uni-directional unit cells, and then adapted to cater for unit cells of the DLR-XT and HITCO woven composites. For both materials, acceptable predictions have been made of stress-strain behavior. Despite the thermal models being based on one-dimensional heat flow, within series-parallel elements, excellent predictions have been made of the degradation in transverse composite thermal conductivity with the composite strain. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that the effect of the degradation of transverse thermal conductivity is due to strain-driven growth of wake debonded cracks.},

To evaluate the ability of both transforms in the damage prognostic it was also proposed the use of Damage Indexes. The matrix damage level occurs during the impulsive load application over the analyzed structures. The finite element used was a Serendipity-type with rectangular shape, 8 nodes and 5 mechanical degrees-of-freedom per node, which was formulated by First-order Shear Deformation Theory on MATLAB (MathWorks{\textregistered}). The dynamic equation of motion including internal damage was solved by the Newmark implicit integration method. The results have demonstrated that mother wavelets, whether discrete or continuous, applied in dynamic signal processing, can detect a small damage magnitude in the matrix level. Moreover, the proposed Damage Indexes can quantify the damage magnitude as well as determine the most appropriate vibration mode and scalar parameter of the Continuous Wavelet Transform for damage detention.},

The thermoelastic properties of the microcracked laminates at different crack densities were determined by finite element analysis of the unit cells bounded by the microcracks. Analytical expressions for the stiffness and coefficients of thermal expansion as functions of crack densities were obtained in the form of response surface approximations. These analytical expressions were then used to predict the formation of a new set of microcracks by equating the change in strain energy in the unit cell before and after the formation of the microcracks to the critical fracture energy required for their formation. Analytical expressions obtained as response surface approximations were also used to predict progressive microcracking. Both displacement and load control cases were considered along with thermal loading. Results from the current methodology agree very well with published data.},

abstract = {The mechanical behavior of a two-dimensional woven SiC/SiC ceramic matrix composite (CMC) under tensile loading is modeled by regarding a three-dimensional unit cell of the composite which takes the waveness of the fiber yarns in two directions into account. The numerical evaluation of the model is accomplished by means of the finite element method (FEM). Because of the small diameter (15 mum) of the fibers in the bundles, these fibers are not considered as single entities in the finite element mesh. Instead the mesh is constructed on the yarn scale considering the fiber bundles as homogeneous with 'fiber bundle' properties, The brittle cracking of interyarn matrix as well as transverse cracking of the fiber bundles are considered by defining a fracture criterion for these components. The increasing degradation of the fiber bundles in fiber direction during progressive loading is described by three damage variables. Damage and cracks are modeled by reducing the elastic coefficients of the finite elements. The scattering of the strength values of the single components is regarded by using Weibull distribution. Before mechanical loading, the structure is subjected to thermal loading to consider the residual thermal stresses in the structure resulting from the cooling down process after fabrication of the composite. The effect of the scattering of the strength values on the behavior of the unit cell will be examined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Interaction between ultrasonic wave and fiber reinforced composites with voids was investigated on the mesoscale by numerical method in this work. DIGIMAT-FE software was used to establish a mesoscale model of void-containing composites, which revealed the real microstructure with randomly distributed voids. Ultrasonic excitation was loaded into the mesoscale model via ABAQUS/Explicit before the finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out. Take T800 carbon fiber/epoxy composite material as an example, the accuracy of the simulated method was verified by comparing the numerical prediction with the analytical and experimental results. Therefore, this simulation method not only can be an effective guidance for manufacturing process but also provide a theoretical basis for reducing void level in order to increase performance of composites. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

A fracture criterion correlating the ultrasonic attenuation to the strength of composite laminates is presented. Good correlation with experimental results of interlaminar shear and flexural strength was obtained. The fatigue test results and the proposed theory indicate that voids have a strong detrimental effect on the fatigue life of composite structures if the void content is above a critical value.

Void shape, distribution, and void content within the composite laminates were characterized using optical microscope. The ILSS was evaluated using short-beam three-point bending tests and their interface debonding failure and fracture surfaces were determined using scanning electron microscope. The experimental results indicated that long strips voids are generated in the low-pressure curing stage. The voids mainly exist in the two forms of rod-like shape and spherical shape, and their number and size decrease as the cure pressure increases. The influence of cure pressure on the void content and ILSS shows a different trend in two stages: when the cure pressure is lower than 0.4 MPa, the ILSS decrease by 5.21{\%} with 1{\%} increase in void content, and their relationship is inversely linear...},

abstract = {This paper describes the fatigue behaviour of newly developed all-polypropylene (all-PP) tapes and composites, with reference to the composite processing conditions, testing temperature and making a comparison with commercial alternatives. All-PP tapes are highly oriented and their failure behaviour follows that of other highly oriented polymers. All-PP woven composites fail ultimately due to PP tape failure. However, this failure mode is accompanied by delamination of fabrics in the woven structure. Consolidation pressure plays a decisive role in controlling the interlaminar properties and hence the delamination resistance and furthermore the fatigue limit of the composite. Comparison of all-PP woven composites with commercial alternatives based on glass and natural fibres reveals the excellent relative performance of all-PP composites under fatigue loads. Fatigue properties of all-PP composites are however sensitive to the testing temperature, and elevated temperatures can lead to a rapid reduction of the fatigue resistance of these all-polymer systems.},

Laminates produced with carbon fiber/epoxy resin unidirectional prepreg have been produced with an intentionally high void content. Short beam shear, three-point flexure, and tensile testing are used for mechanical evaluation and the results correlate to void volume fraction and ultrasonic absorption coefficient. The ultrasonic absorption coefficient is measured for all the specimens and its variation is approximately linear with the void content, corroborating previous experimental results. The effects of these factors on the strength of the composite laminates are discussed in terms of the fracture parameters involved in the fracture criterion.

abstract = {The robust and optimal design of carbon/glass fibre-reinforced epoxy hybrid composite laminates under the constraint of a specified minimum flexural strength was investigated in this study. Two conflicting objectives, minimizing material cost and weight, were considered with the design variables being fibre type, fibre orientation angle and fibre volume fraction of the laminas. Three sources of uncertainties, namely, fibre misalignment, lamina thickness variation and the presence of matrix voids were incorporated into the model. This multi-objective robust optimization problem was solved by combining a modified version of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) with a simple genetic algorithm (GA) as an anti-optimizer. Pareto optimal and robust solutions were found for different levels of minimum flexural strength and the significance of each uncertainty source on the optimal cost and weight of the optimal designs were investigated by conducting analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. The results indicated that, in general, all three uncertainties affected the cost and weight of the optimal designs with the effect of voids being more critical for void contents of greater than 2{\%}.},

abstract = {The effects of porosity on the matrix-dominated mechanical properties of unidirectional carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites were evaluated using X-ray computed tomography and mechanical testing. Carbon fiber-reinforced plastic plates of four porosity levels were manufactured by implementing different curing cycles. Porosity was detected by X-ray computed tomography tests, conducted on samples taken from the plates, and quantified by analyzing the computed tomography scans using the VGStudio Max software. Four different types of mechanical tests were conducted; namely, transverse tension, V-notched rail shear, three-point bending, and short-beam shear tests. The porosity analysis showed that with increasing the porosity volume fraction, the number of pores decreases, their volume increases while their shape changes from spherical or ellipsoidal to a needle-shape. The results from mechanical tests reveal that the presence of pores reduces all matrix-dominated material properties of the UniDirectional (UD) carbon fiber-reinforced plastic material. The reduction in strength is greater than the reduction in the elastic properties. Moreover, the reduction in the in-plane shear and interlaminar properties is greater than the tensile properties of the UD carbon fiber-reinforced plastic material. Between porosity contents of similar volume fraction, the one with the few large pores proved more severe than the one with the many small pores. The large standard deviation observed for some of the tests is attributed to the non-uniform dispersion of pores.},

The mechanical properties of unidirectional laminates depend on the void content and this results in the determination of an optimal curing pressure route which involves minimizing the void content, while the mechanical properties are kept at their maximum level.

abstract = {A series of (0/90)4s laminates with varying void content were fabricated. Two quasi-static mechanical tests, short beam shear and three-point flexure, were used for evaluation and the results correlated to void volume fraction. Accurately quantifying the strength fall off proved difficult. Values of strength drop-off recorded were: 9.7 percent per percent void for interlaminar shear, 10.3 percent per percent void for flexural strength, and 5.3 percent per percent void for flexural modulus. In a manufacturing setting, a 2 percent void content increase will cause an approximate 20 percent decrease in both interlaminar shear strength and flexural strength, accompanied by an approximate 10 percent drop in flexural modulus. Void content has been shown to be a major consideration in composite materials' quality control, regardless of the loading mode.},

abstract = {A novel method for geometry generation of Representative Unit Cells (RUC) of textile composites is presented. The technique retains the advantage of an analytical formulation from industrial practice however introduces variable asymmetric yarn cross-sectional shapes and paths which can be fitted to the yarn shapes and cross-sectional areas as observed from in-situ measurements. In this way interpenetrations and incorrect fibre volume fractions, which occur when using idealized constant yarn cross sections for RUC generation, are avoided. Meshing becomes easier and no fibre volume corrections are required. The new technique is validated through a comparison of 1) the novel RUC to 2) an Idealized RUC with constant yarn cross section; and 3) a model constructed from direct in-situ micro computed X-ray tomographic measurements of a carbon-epoxy weave (In-situ Model). With all three models a reasonable agreement with experimentally obtained elastic properties is found. The stress predicted by the Idealized RUC is significantly different than predicted by the RUC generated with the new method and the In-situ Model. The latter two are in good agreement which indicates that the MESI RUC can be used for material strength prediction. The MESI RUC is also substantially less computationally intensive. Next to the construction of improved RUCs, the technique is an excellent alternative for advanced unit cell generation techniques based on production process simulations in the case that the production process is unknown or an analytic periodic geometry is required.},

abstract = {Composite structures are increasingly used in the transport industry especially in the aeronautical sector thanks to their favorable strength-to-weight ratio with respect to metals. However, this is true if the final part is defects free and complies with quality requirements. A main weakness in composites is porosity, which is likely to be introduced during manufacturing processes and which may knock down the material characteristics affecting its performance in service. Porosity plays a key role in sandwich structures, which involve novel metal foams as core, since the foam performance strongly depends on size and distribution of pores. The determination of porosity is mostly attained by destructive methods, which supply only a general indication linked to the production part number. Conversely, composites may entail local significant variation of porosity, which may be discovered only with effective nondestructive techniques. The attention of the present work is focused on the possibility to use infrared thermography to get information about the amount and distribution of porosity. In particular, two techniques: flash thermography and lock-in thermography are used to comply with requirements of both monolithic composites and metal foams.},

Selected geometries of sandwich beams were tested to illustrate these collapse modes, with good agreement between analytic predictions and measurements of the failure load. Finite element (FE) simulations of the three-point bending responses of these beams were also conducted by constructing a FE model by laying up unidirectional plies in appropriate orientations. The initiation and growth of damage in the laminates were included in the FE calculations. With this embellishment, the FE model was able to predict the measured load versus displacement response and the failure sequence in each of the composite beams.},

The well-known 2D plane strain condition is modelled and validated as a special case of the 3D model. The utility of 3D modelling is further demonstrated to analyse the stress along the fibre length. It is demonstrated that the variation of boundary conditions along the fibre length has a dramatic effect on the stresses. The stresses along fibre length computed through finite element analysis (FEA) are compared against an analytical solution obtained from axi-symmetric concentric cylinder assemblage (CCA) model.

The two primary components of each matrix, the epoxy resin and the thermoplastic, were observed to degrade at different rates under various thermal loading conditions. The epoxy resins degrade predominantly as measured by IR spectroscopy and thermal desorption/gas chromatography mass spectrometry. By using mass loss, strength, and IR spectroscopic data, a correlation was made between strength characteristics of each composite and the relative amount of the two primary matrix components.

abstract = {A new approach has been developed, based on an inverse analysis technique, to determine critical moisture diffusion parameters for a fiber-reinforced composite. This technique incorporates two distinct features: direct experimental observations of the weight gained by a composite material exposed to a humid environment, and highly detailed computational analyses that capture the actual heterogeneous microstructure of the composite. The latter feature was carried out by modeling more than 1000 individual carbon fibers that are randomly distributed within an epoxy matrix. The verification and efficacy of this technique was established by conducting an experiment on a high-grade IM7/997 carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy to determine the maximum moisture content at saturation and the diffusivity of epoxy. With the inverse analysis, the time duration required to estimate these moisture diffusion parameters could be drastically reduced as compared to conventional procedures. Subsequently, the established models were employed to characterize transient moisture absorption process within the composite. Here, it was demonstrated that modeling the heterogeneous microstructure of the composite is critical for obtaining accurate diffusion parameters, and an analytical model with effective properties does not produce correct transient moisture absorption behavior. Furthermore, the evolution of stress fields due to moisture induced volumetric expansion was quantified. It was observed that high stress concentrations develop in regions of fiber concentration. These regions then act as potential failure initiation sites that can lead to lower damage tolerance. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of Acta Materialia Inc.},

abstract = {In this work several numerical techniques for modelling the transverse crush behaviour of honeycomb core materials were developed and compared with test data on aluminium and Nomex??? honeycomb. The methods included a detailed honeycomb micromechanics model, a homogenised material model suitable for use in FE code solid elements, and a homogenised discrete/finite element model used in a semi-adaptive numerical coupling (SAC) technique. The micromechanics model is shown to be suitable for honeycomb design, since it may be used to compute crush energy absorption for different honeycomb cell sizes, cell wall thicknesses and cell materials. However, the very fine meshes required make it unsuitable for analysis of large sandwich structures. The homogenised FE model may be used for such structures, but gives poor agreement when failure is due to core crushing. The SAC model is shown to be most appropriate for use in structural simulations with extensive compression core crushing failures, since the discrete particles are able to model the material compaction during local crushing. ?? 2007.},

abstract = {A finite element analysis was used to quantitatively predict the effect of matrix microcracks in the 90° plies of graphite/epoxy composites on the coefficient of ther mal expansion in the 0° direction, $\alpha$ y (perpendicular to the cracks). Results were generated for [0 m/90n]s, [0/±45/90]s and [0/90/±45] s graphite/epoxy laminate con figurations. Analytical predictions were compared with experimental results for the two quasi-isotropic laminate configurations. Both analytical and experimental results showed that microcracks reduced the effective stiffness of the 90° plies, thus causing the laminates, thermal response to be more like that of a [0] laminate. The change in $\alpha$y was a function of lamina material properties, microcrack density, fiber orientation, and stacking sequence. A combination of classical lamination theory and finite element analysis was used to predict the effect of microcracks in both the 90° and 0° plies. Analytical results showed that the addition of microcracks in the 0° plies do affect $\alpha$y, but to a lesser extent than those in the 90° plies.},

However, in such aeronautical applications, the material is exposed to severe environmental conditions. The present paper aims at assessing an approximate model to evaluate hygrothermoelastic stress in composite laminated plates during moisture desorption taking into account the change of mechanical characteristics induced by the variation of temperature and moisture. The developed method permits us to calculate such stresses during desorption phase without the computation of the moisture concentration, through laminated plates. It observed through this study that the variation of elasticity modulus due to the temperature causes a stress relaxation. These stresses have to be taken into account for the design of composite structures submitted to a moist environment. Through the presented study, we hope to contribute to the understanding of hygrothermal behaviour of composite laminated plates. ?? 2007.},

abstract = {Analyses of debonding along interfaces and of the kinking of interface cracks into a fiber have been used to define the role of debonding in fiber-reinforced, brittle matrix composites. The results reveal that, for fibers aligned with the tensile stress axis, debonding requires an interface fracture energy, $\Gamma$i, less than about one-fourth that for the fiber, $\Gamma$f. Furthermore, once this condition is satisfied, it is shown that fiber failure does not normally occur by deflection of the debond through the fiber. Instead, fiber failure is governed by weakest-link statistics. The debonding of fibers inclined to the stress axis occurs more readily, such that debonds at acutely inclined fibers can deflect into the fiber, whereupon the failure of fibers is dominated by their toughness.},

The algorithm of multi-axial fatigue is applied to matrix-dominated fatigue, while the fibre-dominated fatigue is separately considered. The continuum damage mechanics method is used to describe the properties' deterioration. The stress redistribution introduced by stiffness degradation conjugates the damage evolution. Averaged mechanical properties of the unit cell in pre- and post-fatigue damage stages are calculated at predefined load cycle numbers, using a numerical homogenization technique. The numerical results are validated by experiments of two types of carbon/epoxy plain weave composites, which have the same fibre/resin system but different textile structures. The validation showed good agreement between modelling and experiment.},

Matrix and tows damage mechanisms are respectively introduced through the use of an anisotropic damage model, and an homogenized model based on a micromechan-ical model on the fiber scale. The latter is presented in this paper for the first time. Particular attention is paid to the generation of accurate hexahedral meshes, compatible at the tow–tow and tow–matrix inter-faces. The mesh quality is analyzed using an error estimator variable based on the strain energy density. Damage predictions obtained using tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes are compared for basic loading cases, illustrating the need for using high quality meshes in the growing community of woven composites computational modeling.},

abstract = {The porosity of carbon fibre-reinforced polymers is a very important topic for the practical applications of this material since there is a direct correlation between porosity and mechanical properties, such as shear strength. Therefore the porosity values of carbon fibre-reinforced composites for practical use in aircraft and cars must be lower than a certain level, usually 2.5-5 {\%}. The most common non- destructive method for measuring the porosity is ultrasonic testing, since there is a mostly linear correlation between ultrasonic attenuation and porosity. However, the ultrasonic attenuation coefficient depends not only on the porosity, but also on the shape and distribution of the pores and the presence of other material inhomogeneities. This can lead to significant errors in the determination of the porosity. Acid digestion and materialography are also used for porosity measurement, but both methods are destructive. This paper deals with the application of X-ray computed tomography for the characterization of carbon fibre-reinforced composites, in particular for the quantitative determination of porosity with a reasonable degree of accuracy. In order to attain this, different segmentation methods were applied, systematic computed tomography investigations on a broad variety of composite samples with different measurement parameters were performed and the results are compared with results obtained by standard porosity measurement methods, such as ultrasonic testing and acid digestion. In addition, the possibility of characterizing the size, shape and position of all individual pores and other material inhomogeneities in three dimensions are demonstrated.},

This work extends the micro–meso bridge, previously developed for laminates made of unidirectional plies, to woven composites. Starting from a discrete microscopic description of transverse cracks at the ply's scale, the cracks kinetics is simulated and homogenization relations are introduced to develop a mesoscale model.

abstract = {It has been known for some time now that fabrics that contain fiber tows, which are bundles of thousands of aligned fiber filaments, can be represented as dual-scale porous media; these tows are woven or stitched together and the flow through the resulting fabrics can be modeled to account for the delayed impregnation of tows, which draw fluid away from the advancing flow front. From such flow simulations, one can predict not only the macroflow front, but also the saturation of the fiber tows, as well as determine the partially-saturated region. The simulations require one to input two material parameters to quantify the two distinct length scales of the porous media: the bulk permeability, which characterizes the overall resistance to the flow, and the tow permeability, which is the resistance to the flow within the tow and is related to the saturation of the fiber tows. Techniques to characterize the bulk permeability are well established and can be performed in one, two, and three dimensions; however, methods to measure tow permeability are sparse. Hence, an analytical model is developed to characterize both permeability values: the bulk permeability (K) and the fiber tow permeability (Kt) from a one-dimensional constant flow rate experiment in which the inlet pressure profile during the filling is recorded. These two permeability values determine the time scales of resin impregnation in between the fiber tows and within the fiber tows thus playing an important role in the decision process of how long to leave the resin injection gate open to ensure filling of the fiber tows. For dual-scale preforms, the inlet pressure profile for a constant rate injection is not only dependant on the structure of the preform and fluid viscosity, but also on the mold length. If the mold is sufficiently long, it can be mathematically proven that the partially-saturated region is constant. Examination of the solution also reveals that the partially-saturated length increases as the bulk permeability increases and as the tow permeability decreases. The analytical methodology is demonstrated by characterizing four different fabrics. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) reinforced polyurethane (PU) composite fibers have been fabricated via a twin-screw extrusion method. Significant improvement in Young's modulus and tensile strength were achieved by incorporating MWNTs up to 9.3 wt{\%} while without sacrificing PU elastomer's high elongation at break. Electron microscopy was used to investigate dispersion and fracture surfaces, and Raman technique was used to receive information about degree of graphitization. Results indicated that the homogeneous dispersion of MWNTs throughout PU matrix and strong interfacial adhesion between oxidized MWNTs and the matrix are responsible for the considerable enhancement of mechanical properties of the composite fibers. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A new analytical mesomechanical approach valid for three-axial as well as 3D braided composite materials is described in this paper. This approach is based on a unit cell scheme and takes into account the geometry and the mechanical properties of both phases, the fiber and the matrix. A finite element analysis has been carried out in order to obtain comparable results between this numerical technique and the new analytical approach proposed in this paper. Two different configurations of 3D braided carbon fiber/epoxy matrix composites have been studied, according to the geometry of the braided preforms: [0??/??20??] and [0??/??30??]. A failure criterion taking into account yarn and matrix degradation has been applied to predict theoretically failure in both configurations. In order to assess the accuracy of the results from both analytical and finite element approaches, an experimental program was performed. A uniaxial tensile stress testing was carried out in both longitudinal and transverse directions of three axial braided specimens. Results obtained in the tests as well as the analytical and finite element approaches will be discussed. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Zhandarov2006,
abstract = {Typical interfacial strength parameters calculated from the microbond and pull-out tests are the ultimate (local) interfacial shear strength, $\tau$d, and the critical energy release rate, Gic. These two parameters are often considered as criteria for interfacial failure. Several years ago, we proposed a new interfacial parameter, adhesional pressure ($\sigma$d), which is the normal (tensile) stress component at the fiber-matrix interface at the moment of the debonding onset near the crack tip. Adhesional pressure has the following advantages as an interfacial parameter and eventual failure criterion: (a) it corresponds to the actual mechanism of crack initiation in the microbond test (interfacial debonding starts in tensile mode), and (b) the $\sigma$d value is directly proportional to the work of adhesion, WA, between the fiber and matrix surfaces. In this paper, we investigated, both theoretically and experimentally, the applicability of the adhesional pressure as an interfacial failure criterion. Several fiber-polymer pairs have been tested using a microbond technique, and local interfacial parameters ($\tau$d, Gic and $\sigma$d) for these systems have been measured. Assuming $\sigma$d = const, we analyzed the initiation of interfacial crack (the debond force, Fd, as a function of the embedded length, le) as well as crack propagation (variation of the crack length with the load applied to the fiber) and dependencies of the peak force, Fmax, and the apparent shear strength, $\tau$app, on the embedded length. Residual thermal stresses and interfacial friction were included in our analysis. A comparison with two other interfacial failure criteria ($\tau$d and Gic) was made depending on specimen geometry (cylindrical specimens; spherical matrix droplets). It was found that all three parameters satisfactorily describe interfacial failure in a microbond test, yielding asymptotically (at large embedded lengths) very close predictions for Fmax and $\tau$app as functions of the embedded length. They also predict equally well the interfacial crack growth under increasing external load for not very large crack lengths. For shorter embedded lengths, the three interfacial criteria yield substantially different results, e.g. finite $\tau$app value as le → 0 from the $\tau$d criterion, infinite $\tau$app from Gic = const, and zero $\tau$app from $\sigma$d = const. In this range of le's, the local interfacial strength, $\tau$d, appears to be the best failure criterion. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Constitutive equations are derived for the elastic response of composites with thermoplastic-elastomer matrices at arbitrary three-dimensional deformations with finite strains. With reference to the homogenization method, a composite is thought of as an incompressible network of strands bridged by permanent junctions (filler particles and micro-domains in the crystalline or glassy states). Unlike conventional models for rubber elasticity, excluded-volume interactions between segments are taken into account. An explicit expression is developed for the strain energy density of a network of flexible chains with weak self-repellent interactions, and a phenomenological equation is suggested for the mechanically induced evolution in strength of segment interactions. The stress-strain relations involve three to four material constants that are found by matching experimental data on thermoplastic elastomers reinforced with short fibres and in situ composites with liquid-crystalline fillers. Good agreement is demonstrated between the observations and the results of numerical simulation at uniaxial tension with elongation ratios up to 1300{\%}. It is shown that (i) adjustable parameters in the constitutive equations are affected by thermo-mechanical factors in a physically plausible way, and (ii) the model can predict the elastic response at one deformation mode when its material parameters are determined by fitting observations at another mode. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Specimens are loaded cyclically in tension and tension. Their S-N curves and the fatigue strength of about 0.8UTS at around N = 104 were obtained. Macroscopic and microscopic characteristics are discussed to yield the cyclic failure mechanism as follows. In a low cycle region, the decrease of shear resistance caused by wear at the fiber/matrix interface increases the probability of fiber break, while after about 104 cycles the smoother interface and longer debonding area suppress the decrease of shear resistance. Thus, the probability of fiber break does not increase. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The erodent used is silica sand with the size range 150-250 ??m of irregular shapes. The result shows semi-ductile erosion behaviour with maximum erosion rate at 60?? impingement angle. The erosion rate (R) displays a strong dependence on impact velocity (V), which follows and the power law R ??? Vn for all the materials. We find that erosive wears of GFRP composite with 4 g flyash as filler is the lowest. This filler restricts fibre-matrix debonding. Pure glass epoxy without any filler shows the highest erosion rate due to weak bonding strength.

A series of tests such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transfer infrared (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) have been performed to characterize the morphology and thermal properties of the graft polymer and its nanocomposite. Results show that the graft polymer (VTMS-g-PE) chains have been successfully intercalated into OMT layers proved by XRD data (a d-spacing of 3.4 nm) and TEM images; the PE chains have been chemically bounded to the OMT layers proved by FTIR spectra; the nanocomposite exhibits a higher thermal-oxidative stability than that of either the VTMS-grafted-LLDPE or the LLDPE proved by TGA curves. The increase in thermal properties lies in two facts: one is the formation of chemical bonds between PE macromolecules and OMT layers during silane graft reaction; the other is the in situ graft of PE macromolecules onto the OMT surfaces during thermal-oxidative degradation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Results showed that, compatibilization of nylon and LCP in the presence of MA-grafted elastomer and glass fibers is the primary factor promoting LCP fibrillation in toughened glass fiber filled hybrid composites. Glass fibers serve as inert fillers modifying the interfacial interaction between the toughened nylon 66 and LCP phases. Morphology of the rheometer extrudates observed with scanning electron microscopy was consistent with the predictions from rheological results. The influence of rheology and morphology on the mechanical properties was also examined.

abstract = {With the aim of obtaining materials with high thermal conductivities for solid state thermal management applications, metal-matrix composites were produced by reinforcing aluminum and aluminum-silicon with diamond single crystals via two different liquid metal infiltration techniques - gas pressure infiltration and mechanically assisted infiltration (squeeze casting). The obtained composites exhibited thermal conductivities as high as 670 W/mK, but also as low as 130 W/mK. The large variation in the thermal conductivities can be related to the microstructural characteristics of the interface between diamond and the metal-matrix. On fracture surfaces of the composites, it was found that preferential adhesion between aluminum and diamond occurs on the {\{}1 0 0{\}} faces of diamond. Chemical and electrochemical etching treatments of the composites along with TEM observations of interfacial cross-sections suggest that this adhesion may be attributed to the local formation of aluminum carbide at the diamond surface. The contact time between melt and diamond during processing and also the addition of silicon to the matrix material were found to significantly affect the thermal conductivity of the composites by modification of the interface. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The 0?? (loading direction) and 90?? (perpendicular to loading direction) oriented minicomposites as well as the open porosity and excess SiC associated with CVI SiC composites were all modeled as parallel elements using simple Rule of Mixtures techniques. Excellent agreement for a variety of 2D woven Hi-Nicalon??? fiber-reinforced and Sylramic-iBN reinforced CVI SiC matrix composites that differed in numbers of plies, constituent content, thickness, density, and number of woven tows in either direction (i.e, balanced weaves versus unbalanced weaves) was achieved. It was found that elastic modulus was not only dependent on constituent content, but also the degree to which 90?? minicomposites carried load. This depended on the degree of interaction between 90?? and 0?? minicomposites which was quantified to some extent by composite density. The relationships developed here for elastic modulus only necessitated the knowledge of the fractional contents of fiber, interphase and CVI SiC as well as the tow size and shape. It was concluded that such relationships are fairly robust for orthogonally loaded 2D woven CVI SiC composite system and can be implemented by ceramic matrix composite component modelers and designers for modeling the local stiffness in simple or complex parts fabricated with variable constituent contents. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Thermal conductivity, diffusivity and specific heat of polyester/natural fibre (banana/sisal) composites were investigated as function of filler concentration and for several fibre surface treatments. The thermophysical behaviour of hybrid pineapple leaf fibre (PALF) and glass fibre reinforced polyester composites has been also evaluated for a constant total fibre loading of 0.40 Vf by varying the ratio of PALF and glass. The results show that chemical treatment of the fibres reduces the composite thermal contact resistance. Hybridisation of natural fibre with glass allows a significantly better heat transport ability of the composite. The thermal conductivity measured in the direction transverse to the plane of composite plate could be well represented by a series prediction model. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A micro-genetic algorithm was implemented to carry out the optimization process. An a posteriori approach was used to obtain a set of optimal solutions.

The model assumes strength is determined by fibre breaks within a representative volume element (RVE). Its length is equal to the so-called ineffective length, associated with the stress transfer to a broken fibre. An elastic-plastic stress transfer model is used to determine the ineffective length, while fibre strength is described by a Weibull distribution. The longitudinal tensile strength is then obtained by solving numerically an equation for the maximum load supported by the RVE. A closed-form expression was also obtained by neglecting elastic stress transfer and the contribution of broken fibres. The closed-form solution was found to be in very good agreement with the base model. In spite of the high level of uncertainty on model input data, model predictions agreed quite well with experimental strengths of carbon fibre composites. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical simulation based analysis of micro-cracking in short fiber reinforced polymer composites. For this case, the conventional linear elastic fracture mechanics approach is shown not to be useful; instead, the Rice-Tracey ductile fracture model is shown to work well in the framework of the local approach to fracture. The model is first applied to the case of matrix cracking from the broken fiber end in a fiber fragmentation test of a single-fiber reinforced composite. The model predicts the measured conical crack path successfully, including the crack initiation angle and the kink formation as the crack propagates away from the fiber. Furthermore, the predicted dependence of the crack length on the nominal strain is found to be in qualitative agreement with measured data. Next the model is applied to micro-cracking in an aligned short fiber composite. The analysis predicts propagation of a matrix crack from the debonded fiber end towards the neighboring fiber at an oblique angle to the fiber axis. Before reaching the neighboring fiber, the crack is found to divert gradually towards the fiber axis. This behavior explains the so-called fiber-avoidance cracking mode reported in the literature. A parametric study is performed to reveal the dependence of the locally-averaged failure stress/strain on the fiber length and volume fraction. ?? 2006.},

Both comprehensive index and evaluating merit are two novel parameters established and applied to the multi-objective optimization of friction material formulations. Optimization of ceramic friction formulations was implemented in three phases: (a) screen out the optimal one from the initial nine formulations in terms of their friction characteristics; (b) according to the comprehensive evaluation index, the volume fraction of the most advantageous ingredient for friction performance was increased and the most disadvantageous one was decreased correspondingly; and (c) the volume fraction of binder was varied and other ingredients' amounts were also changed proportionally.

abstract = {Polypropylene/fumed silica nanocomposites were prepared via melt mixing using a twin-screw co-rotating extruder. To improve the dispersion degree of the nanoparticles, maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (PP-g-MA) was used as a compatibilizer. From transmission electron microscopy it was found that agglomerations of silica particles into the PP matrix increased in average size with increasing silica contents whilst they decreased at higher PP-g-MA amounts. Storage modulus values of prepared nanocomposites measured by DMTA were sensitive to the microstructure of the nanocomposites. Higher silica contents resulted in higher storage modulus, evidence revealing that the material became stiffer. By adding the PP-g-MA copolymer a further increase of storage modulus was observed due to the finer dispersion of the filler in the matrix and the increased interfacial adhesion. Both permitted a much more efficient transfer of stresses from the polymer matrix to the SiO2 nanoparticles. Crystallization rates were found to increase by increasing silica nanoparticles as well as PP-g-MA content. In fact for a given PP-g-MA content increasing the silica content up to 5-7.5 wt{\%} accelerated the crystallization. Further increase of the nanoparticles amount did not have any effect. Permeability rates of O2 and N2 through films of iPP/SiO2 were also measured. Lower rates were observed compared to pure iPP, most notably for O2, which decreased with increasing concentrations of silica. This was attributed to the more tortuous path which must be covered by the gas molecules, since silica nanoparticles are considered impenetrable by them. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The experimental critical buckling loads of plates have been found by clamping from the two edges and then these results have been compared with the results obtained from the numerical analyses. For the numerical analyses, ANSYS 6.1 FEA program has been used. It has been seen that the results obtained the numerical buckling analyses are very close to the experimental results. In the light of this harmony, the numerical analyses for different delamination diameters and fiber orientations have been done and from these analyses, it has been seen that the important decreases occur in the critical buckling loads after a certain value of the delamination diameter and the different fiber orientations also affect to these loads. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, the strain energy of the array is decomposed into components due to flexure, extensional and shearing stresses. Finally the relative contribution of each component to the array total strain energy is examined for the 7, 61 and 127 CNT arrays. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study presents characterization of thermo-mechanical viscoelastic behaviors of thick-section multi-layered fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials. The studied multi-layered systems follow viscoelastic behaviors of thermo-rheologically complex materials (TCM), which allow for stress and temperature variation with time. The multi-layered composites consist of alternating layers of unidirectional fiber (roving) and randomly oriented continuous filament mat (CFM). Isothermal creep-recovery tests at various stresses and temperatures are performed on axial, transverse, and 45?? off-axis specimens having E-glass/vinylester and E-glass/polyester systems. Both tension and compression creep tests are conducted for 30 min followed by 10 min recovery. Analytical representation of a nonlinear single integral equation is applied to model the thermo-mechanical viscoelastic responses. Long-term material behaviors are then obtained through the vertical and horizontal shifting using analytical and graphical shifting procedures. The vertical and horizontal shift factors are associated with nonlinear stress and temperature dependent parameters. Linear extrapolation of transient creep compliance can be used to extend the material responses for longer times. The extended long-term (8-16 months) creep strains of the uniaxial specimens are verified with the long-term experimental data of Scott and Zureick [Compression creep of a pultruded E-glass/vinylester composite, Compos Sci Technol, 58 (1998) 1361-1369]. Finally, sensitivity analyses are conducted to examine the impact of error in material parameter characterizations to the overall long-term material behaviors. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The viability of using magnetic particulate susceptor materials for induction heating during bonding of polymer matrix composites is investigated in this work. Hysteresis heating is tailored through careful design of the microstructure of nickel particulate polymer films. An excellent heating rate is attained in the frequency range of 1-10 MHz for particle volume fraction below percolation of 0.26. The diameter of nickel particle should be kept between 65 nm and 10 ??m to ensure multi-domain heating and low particle oxidation. The hysteresis heating behavior of the particulate films is found to be volumetric in nature and proportional to the cubic of applied magnetic field. Over the range studied, heat generation is inversely proportional to the size of the multi-domain particles. Curie temperature control is observed when sufficiently high magnetic fields are applied. The master curves of AC heat generation in Ni/PSU films are established and show a strong particle size effect. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This investigation attempts to characterize the material principal diffusivities of a unidirectional composite laminate. Diffusion of moisture in an orthotropic plate immersed in water conforms to Fick's diffusion law. Assuming moisture absorption induces proportional hygric strain in the laminate, the hygric strain is expressed as a function of the moisture concentration that depends on the specimen geometry, material diffusivities, and diffusion duration. Immersion tests of unidirectional carbon/epoxy laminate were conducted, and suspension method was adopted to monitor continuously the hygric expansion of the specimen in water without retrieving it from water. Specimens of different dimensions were used. Data of the hygric strain verse immersion duration are used to derive the material diffusivities by least square curve fitting. The result indicates that the diffusivity in fiber's longitudinal direction of unidirectional T700 carbon/epoxy laminate is much greater than that in the thickness direction, and also the deviations of the derived diffusivities are proportional to the square of the corresponding dimension (width or thickness). ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A multilayer composite material composed of 70 alternate layers of ultrahigh carbon steel (UHCS) and mild steel (MS) has been processed by hot roll bonding in two steps. First, seven layers were rolled to obtain a block. Second, 10 blocks, each one containing seven layers, were rolled to obtain the composite. Therefore, two types of interfaces were present in the laminate. Damage tolerance properties of the laminated composite material have been studied by Charpy impact, three-point bending and shear tests. The impact toughness of the composite is 70 times higher than for the UHCS and 1.5 higher than for the MS. This improvement is due to delamination at the interfaces between the blocks. This mechanism obstructs the propagation of the dominant crack causing its deflection along the interface and forcing renucleation of cracks in the adjacent layer. Three-point bend and shear tests were performed to evaluate the fracture toughness of the laminate and the bond strength of the single layers in the composite. This study reveals the role of both types of interfaces on crack deflection for increasing the damage tolerance of the laminate composite material. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

MCC was treated with N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) containing lithium chloride (LiCl) in order to swell the MCC and partly separate the cellulose whiskers. The suspension of whiskers was pumped into the polymer melt during the extrusion process. Different microscopy techniques, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction and mechanical testing were used to study the structure and properties of the whiskers and composites. The results showed that DMAc/LiCl can be used as swelling/separation agent for MCC but seems to cause degradation of the composites at high temperature processing. The structure of composites was made up of partly separated nanowhiskers when PEG was used as processing aid. The mechanical properties of nanocomposites were improved and compared to reference material the elongation to break was increased about 800{\%} for one material combination. The future studies will be focused on process optimization, dispersion of nanowhiskers and finding a more suitable pumping medium to avoid thermal degradation of the composite. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The CMC consisted of silicon carbide fiber with an in situ BN layer (iBN) reinforced in silicon carbide matrix with boron nitride (BN) interphase. Two series of tests were conducted; tension-tension fatigue tests at a frequency of 10 Hz with a stress ratio of 0.1 and stress-rupture tests. Both type of tests were conducted at 750 ??C: (1) under dry environment test condition (with 0{\%} moisture content) and (2) under humid environment test condition (with 60{\%} moisture content). Stress versus time to failure relationships were established under these test conditions. Moisture (humid environment) decreased the time to failure at a prescribed stress level in comparison to that without moisture (dry condition) in both series of tests. For a given test environment, time to failure was shorter under the cycling loading condition of fatigue test than that under the constant load of stress-rupture test. Damage analysis showed that the exposure to the elevated temperature caused the embrittlement of BN interphase between fiber and matrix. The presence of moisture accelerated this embrittlement process, which in turn caused the more degradation of fatigue or stress-rupture performance of the tested CMC system in humid test environment in comparison to that in dry test environment. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of this, a failure criterion for prediction of failure caused by kinking under multiaxial (axial compression and shear) loading has been adapted to a NCF composite system. The criterion has been validated for compression tests of quasi-isotropic laminates tested in uniaxial compression. By performing compression tests of the laminate at different off-axis angles, it was possible to vary the ratio of compressive axial stress/shear stress in the specimens. The test results proved that the criterion works well for predictions of kinking governed failure for the present material system. Detailed fractographic studies confirmed that formation of kink bands was the mechanism responsible for specimen failure. Kink bands were also found to develop at loads significantly lower than load at specimen failure. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The most important aspect of formulating unit cells for micromechanical analysis of materials of patterned microstructures is the derivation of appropriate boundary conditions for them. There is lack of a comprehensive account on the derivation of boundary conditions in the literature, while the use of unit cells in micromechanical analyses is on an increasing trend. This paper is devoted to the generation of such an account, where boundary conditions are derived entirely based on considerations of symmetries which are present in the microstructure. The implications of the boundary conditions used for a unit cell are not always clear and therefore have been discussed. It has been demonstrated that unit cells of the same appearance but subject to boundary conditions derived based on different symmetry considerations may behave rather differently. One of the objectives of the paper is to inform users of unit cells that to introduce a unit cell one needs not only mechanically correct boundary conditions but also a clear sense of the microstructure under consideration. Otherwise the results of such analyses could mislead. ?? 2008.},

abstract = {The mechanical behavior of polymer-matrix composites unidirectionally reinforced with carbon or glass fibers subjected to compression perpendicular to the fibers was studied using computational micromechanics. The stress-strain curve was determined by the finite element analysis of a representative volume element of the microstructure idealized as a random dispersion of parallel fibers embedded in the polymeric matrix. The dominant damage mechanisms experimentally observed - interface decohesion and matrix plastic deformation - were included in the simulations, and a parametrical study was carried out to assess the influence of matrix and interface properties on the stress-strain curve, compressive strength, ductility and the corresponding failure modes. It was found that the composite properties under transverse compression were mainly controlled by interface strength and the matrix yield strength in uniaxial compression. Two different fracture modes were identified, depending on whether failure was controlled by the nucleation of interface cracks or by the formation of matrix shear bands. Other parameters, such as matrix friction angle, interface fracture energy or thermo-elastic residual stresses, played a secondary role in the composite mechanical behavior. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this article, two-scale 3D finite element (FE) models, the microscopic repeated unit cell (RUC) model for yarn, and mesoscopic-repeated unit cell model for woven composite, are presented to predict the effective stiffness properties of 3D woven orthogonal interlock composites. The micro-RUC model for the yarn is based on a hexagonal array of fibers. Undulation of the yarns in the novel 3-D meso-RUC for the woven composite is described by Hermit-spline function. The periodic boundary conditions are applied to the two-scale models during the 3D FE analysis in order to ensure that both the displacement and stress are continuous on the boundary surfaces. Specimens are manufactured with house-made resin transfer molding (RTM) equipment and simple tensile experiment is performed. It is found that the predicted yarn properties by the micro-RUC agree well with data computed by equations with a suitable parameter determined by experiment and the predicted effective stiffness properties of 3-D woven composites by the meso-RUC are also in good agreement with the test data. Thus the correctness of the established multi-scale models and analysis method are verified.},

abstract = {In the present work, the influence of manufacturing induced voids on damage mechanisms at the microscopic scale was analysed on [45/-45/0]s laminates subjected to tension fatigue loading. Microscopic observations of the top surface of the 45° ply revealed that the first event of damage at the microscopic scale was the initiation of multiple micro-cracks in the matrix between the fibres, located preferentially in correspondence of the voids in that layer. The subsequent coalescence of these micro-cracks gave rise to the formation of a crack propagating in the 45° fibres direction. This is qualitatively the same scenario observed in void-free specimens in a recent work by the authors, thus confirming that the same crack initiation criterion can be applied in the absence and presence of voids. In addition, the micro-scale damage is shown to evolve faster and therefore off-axis cracks to initiate earlier and in a larger quantity in the presence of voids.},

abstract = {A methodology is proposed for the construction of a representative volume element (RVE) for analysis of laminated composites containing two arrays of ply cracks running in different directions. The only requirement is that the cracks in any ply are uniformly spaced, and if more than one ply of a given orientation is cracked, then the crack spacing of individual plies must only be in exact multiples of each other. The spacing of cracks in the two directions can be fully independent. The RVE is constructed through a systematic consideration of translational symmetries present in the cracked laminate. As a result, the boundary conditions on the RVE can be imposed without compromising accuracy. Examples of the application of the RVE methodology are given to illustrate its broad capability and a finite element (FE) stress analysis is performed for these cases to illustrate results such as the crack surface displacements, local stress fields and RVE-averaged elastic properties. For one case, the average properties are compared with experimental results, showing good agreement.},

For example, the single fibre ‘composite' test, in which the fibre is fragmented, appears to be providing frictional data only. In contrast, the fibre pull-out test can provide debonding energies, and data on friction after debonding. The results of this test suggest that the governing criterion for interface failure in carbon-epoxies and glass-reinforced epoxy and polyester resins is based on energy rather than stress.},

abstract = {The effects of laminate thickness on the tension–compression fatigue behavior of [0/45/90/-45]ns (n=2,4,6) T300/976 carbon/epoxy composites damaged by low-energy impact have been investigated. The penetration impact properties and the residual tensile strength under various low-energy impacts were tested. The initial slope during penetration impact reveals that the thicker laminate has a higher stiffness than the thinner one. Moreover, the results also show that the total energy required to penetrate the composite is not proportional to the thickness. The static tensile strength measurements and tension–compression fatigue tests at various stress levels were also carried out on the impacted and unimpacted laminates. The median-rank method and Weibull distribution function were applied to predict the failure probability of the composites under given applied loading and fatigue cycles. The relationship between stress levels and fatigue life (S–N curve) was established and reductions in fatigue life of the impacted laminates at various stress levels were compared. The different slopes of the S–N curves imply that different fracture mechanisms may occur, depending on the laminate. The S–N curves of the composites with different thicknesses were also compared. Ultrasonic C-scanning was used to examine the damage zones in composites subjected to various impact energies and fatigue loadings.},

abstract = {An analytical solution is derived to describe the correlation between the thermal resistance change and fiber damage evolution in unidirectional composites under loading conditions. A key parameter, thermal characteristic length, is obtained, which represents the sensitivity of the thermal property change to mechanical damage. A coupled thermal-mechanical model is also developed to predict the failure stress, internal fiber breakage and thermal resistance change as a function of applied strain. The results show that the number of fiber breaks is proportional to thermal resistance change during loading while the thermal resistance change increases exponentially with increasing the applied strain. The analytical solution is in good agreement with the numerical results. Finite element models are developed to verify the coupled thermal-mechanical models. The present study shows that longitudinal thermal resistance change is sensitive to damage in a predictable manner and can be used together to improve the reliability of damage assessment during loading of carbon fiber reinforced polymer. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Aiming this objective, a new lightweight Fiber/Metal Laminate (FML) has been developed. The combination of metal and polymer composite laminates can create a synergistic effect on many properties. The mechanical properties of FML shows improvements over the properties of both aluminum alloys and composite materials individually. Due to their excellent properties, FML are being used as fuselage skin structures of the next generation commercial aircrafts. One of the advantages of FML when compared with conventional carbon fiber/epoxy composites is the low moisture absorption. The moisture absorption in FML composites is slower when compared with polymer composites, even under the relatively harsh conditions, due to the barrier of the aluminum outer layers. Due to this favorable atmosphere, recently big companies such as EMBRAER, Aerospatiale, Boing, Airbus, and so one, starting to work with this kind of materials as an alternative to save money and to guarantee the security of their aircrafts.},

abstract = {Fibrous composites offer outstanding material properties and adaptability for use in the aerospace industry. With the discovery of carbon nanotubes, the prospect of enhancing existing mechanical and thermal properties of composite materials has led to a massive effort to understand the effects nanotubes have on existing materials. An important material property associated with composite laminates is the interlaminar shear strength. This property relates the amount of shear stress a specific material will handle before individual plies fail in shear. Because carbon nanotubes have exceptional stiffness and tensile strength, it is proposed that adding them to the fiber-matrix interface of composite laminates will enhance material shear strength properties. After receiving two composite plates made of T650/Epon 862/W carbon fiber/epoxy, one 12-ply material with Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) sprayed along the midplane and the other, 12-ply material without SWCNTs, the Texas A{\&}M University Nanotechnology Research Group decided to test the effect SWCNTs have on the interfacial shear strength of composite laminates. The short beam shear test described by the American Society of Testing and Materials [1] offers an easy and repeatable method for testing the apparent interlaminar shear strength of composite materials and was performed on 5 specimens of each material. Results for the testing revealed anticipated load-displacement curves resulting in interlaminar failure of each specimen. The specimens without SWCNTs produced slightly higher average short beam shear strength of 57.158 MPa with a coefficient of variation of 1.223{\%} and failed in shear along the specimen midplanes. The specimens with SWCNTs produced slightly lower average short beam shear strength of 56.680 MPa with a coefficient of variation of 1.378{\%} and failed in shear along two ply interfaces neighboring the midplane. Although the specimens without SWCNTs produced slightly higher short beam strength values, the difference was less than 1{\%} and is insignificant. In previous testing, results were obtained which indicated that SWCNT-infused specimens failed in shear away from the nanotube coated midplane whereas blank specimens failed in shear along the midplane. This suggested that the nanotubes created a strengthening effect in shear. However, results obtained from this test reveal no difference in failure between SWCNT specimens and blank specimens. Both failed in shear slightly above and below the midplane. It is recommended that additional short beam shear testing be performed on existing material and that other testing such as the double-cantilever test or additional short beam shear tests be performed on future materials.},

abstract = {The remaining useful life of a system can be predicted from available data and/or physical models, which is commonly known as prognosis. In this paper, the remaining useful life (e.g., the number of cycles to failure) of a system experiencing fatigue crack growth is estimated using a simple physical model. This paper shows that a simple model, such as the Paris model with an assumed analytical stress-intensity factor, can be used for complex geometries by compensating for the error in the assumed stress-intensity factor by adjusting model parameters. The adjustment is done automatically by a process of Bayesian identification. True damage growth is simulated using the extended finite-element method to model the effects of crack location and geometry on the relationship between crack size and stress-intensity factor. The detection process of crack size using structural health monitoring systems is modeled by adding random noise and a deterministic bias to the simulated damage growth. Equivalent model parameters are then identified using the Bayesian inference, from which the remaining useful life is estimated. Using three examples of damage geometries, it is shown that the remaining useful life estimates are accurate even with the use of an assumed analytical stress-intensity factor.},

abstract = {Fiber-reinforced composites can be engineered to exhibit high strength, high stiffness, and high toughness, and are, thus, attractive alternatives to monolithic polymer, metals, and ceramics in structural applications. To engineer the material for high performance, the relationship between material microstructure and its properties must be established to accurately predict the deformation and failure. Such a relationship between underlying constituent material properties and composite performance can also aid selection and/or optimization of new composite systems. Successful models can yield predictive insight into the origins of damage tolerance, size scaling, and reliability of existing composite systems and can be extended to investigate damage and failure under more complex loading and environmental conditions, such as fatigue and stress rupture.},

abstract = {Despite the crucial significance of failure prediction in composites, such an objective remains challenging, even in unidirectional (UD) systems. A strength model for UD composites was used that has great versatility in handling various matrix and fibre behaviours. This model includes a simplified superposition principle that was found to be reliable in predicting stress concentration factors irrespective of the presence of matrix cracks. The model revealed the negligible influence of matrix cracks on stress concentrations, ineffective length, cluster development and failure strain. The presence of matrix cracks can therefore be safely neglected in models for UD composites. This information is important for experimental validations and for advancing the state of the art in strength models for UD composites.},

The compressive behaviors degradation of the braided composite is attributed to the epoxy resin degradation and interface debonding.

abstract = {The weight change and retention of in-plane shear (±45°) strength of graphite fibre-reinforced cyanate ester resin matrix composites have been estimated on exposure to high humidity and thermal cycling, respectively. Cyanate ester resin matrix composites absorbed a remarkably small amount of moisture on exposure to high humidity. However, the degree of moisture absorption underwent a rather sudden increase to a new equilibrium level after prolonged exposure. A morphology study showed the occurrence of extensive cracking in the matrix/interface region in the form of delamination between plies as well as translaminar cracking within plies. The phenomenon is believed to be caused by weakening of the fibre-matrix interface, which was confirmed by microscopic analysis of fracture surfaces. A sudden moisture gain associated with extensive matrix/interface cracking was found to reduce the in-plane shear strength and fatigue lifetime at a given stress amplitude. The slope of the S-N curve was lower for wet specimens, implying a higher growth rate of local cracks as well as delamination. The rate of in-plane shear strength degradation was also measured on static exposure to dry heat as well as after thermal cycling to a peak temperature of 150 or 204°C. At a frequency of 10 min/cycle and for a relatively short duration, the effect of thermal cycling seems to be represented by the cumulative sum of thermal oxidation effects at the peak temperature.},

abstract = {The moisture absorption of cyanate ester modified epoxy resin matrices has been studied under thermal spiking conditions. Enhanced moisture absorption has been observed at spike-temperatures above 120°C. The results of the desorption studies on both control specimens and the spiked specimens showed that some of the water molecules remained entrained in the polymer. It is postulated that this water could be associated with that which is hydrogen bonded or from the hydrolysis of isolated residual cyanate ester groups because the concentration of entrained water remains constant at spike-temperatures below 180°C. Above 180°C a thermally activated process, leading to chain scission as indicated by a reduced recoverability of the glass transition temperature (Tg) on drying. On isothermal resorption, the moisture concentration was found to be similar to that achieved through thermal spiking, showing that the entrained water at the lower spike-temperatures can also be achieved under mild conditions. The Tg is reversibly recovered to within 5°C, which indicates a degree of relaxation rather than degradation. The moisture diffusion coefficient estimated from the resorption curves is lower than those estimated from the absorption and desorption curves. The isothermal resorption diffusion coefficient also decreased with increasing spike temperature. It is proposed that thermal spiking induced a relaxation of the network but as the spike-temperature approaches the transition region of the wet polymer, further hydrolytically induced relaxation events become feasible.},

abstract = {One of the important factors, which determine the concentration of moisture that a polymer will absorb, is the effect of non-random mixing whereby water-clustering is said to occur. The Flory–Huggins theory cannot predict the isotherms observed for highly polar polymers since the theory assumes complete random mixing. The complementary model of Brown [Brown GL. In: Rowland SP, editor. Water in polymers. Washington, DC: American Chemical Society; 1980. p. 441. [1]] considers the moisture distribution in polar polymers, consists of components associated with random mixing (Flory–Huggins theory) and clustering of the water molecules. Moisture sorption isotherms of cyanate ester/epoxy blends at different relative humidities have been analysed by the clustering theory of Brown [Brown GL. In: Rowland SP, editor. Water in polymers. Washington, DC: American Chemical Society; 1980. p. 441. [1]] and the dual mode sorption theory of Zimm [Zimm BH. J Chem Phys 1953;21:934. [2]]. Clustering was found to occur in cyanate ester/epoxy blends conditioned at relative humidities of 40{\%} and higher. The Cluster size indicates that the majority of the absorbed water in a cured cyanate ester/epoxy blend was not clustered but present in monomeric form through hydrogen bonding to polar sites. It is postulated that the phenomenon of thermal spiking enhanced moisture absorption can be explained by an equilibrium between cluster formation and declustering associated with network relaxation at the spike-temperature.},

Unconditioned Ti FML specimens showed composite prepreg failure, whereas conditioned specimens exhibited delamination at the metal/composite prepreg interface as the primary failure mode. Plasticizing and swelling of the epoxy resin due to the combined effect of elevated temperature and water absorption, caused the generation of residual stresses that resulted in delamination at the metal/composite prepreg and fiber/resin interfaces.

The influence of the composition of the matrix on the interfacial nature of the GF/mBT composites were studied and compared with that of the composite based on GF and BT resin using contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and dielectric properties over wide frequency and temperature ranges. Results show that the interfacial nature of the composites is dependent on the chemistries of the matrices, mBT matrices have better interfacial adhesion with GF than BT resin owing to the formation of chemical and hydrogen bonds between mBT resin and GF; while in the case of mBT resins, the content of HBPSi also plays an important role on the interfacial feature and thus the macro-performance. Specifically, with increasing the content of HBPSi in the matrix, the interlaminate shear strength of corresponding composites significantly improves, demonstrating that better interfacial adhesion guarantees outstanding integrated properties of the resultant composites.},

abstract = {For a [0/90]s cross-ply laminate subject to uniaxial loading, this paper presents the results of comparisons between the model predictions of stress/strain behaviour, carried out in Part A of the Failure Exercise, and the corresponding experimental data provided after the predictions had been made. In addition, because a new model designed for general symmetric laminates has since been developed, comparisons are shown between the stress/strain predictions of the new model applied to quasi-isotropic and [±$\theta$]s laminates (with $\theta$=45 and 55°), and the corresponding experimental data provided to participants in the failure exercise. Very good correlations between the model and experimental stress/strain data have been achieved for both the cross-ply and quasi-isotropic laminates (subject to both uniaxial and biaxial loading), principally because ply cracking in a single orientation is expected to occur for a significant part of the stress/strain curves. The correlation for [±$\theta$]s laminates is not as good because the model is not able to account for ply crack formation in both the +$\theta$ and −$\theta$ plies of the laminate. In addition, the model has not yet been modified to deal with mixed-mode ply crack growth, or with non-linear matrix behaviour which could lead to significant deviations between model predictions and experimental results at large strains. It is emphasised that the models used are not able by themselves to predict strength. Additional damage modes must be taken into account (e.g. fibre fracture) before predictions of strength can be made that are based on the modelling of physical micro-mechanisms associated with laminate failure. A rudimentary physically based approach to the prediction of laminate failure is made by considering fibre strain within the laminate in relation to the average failure strain of a single fibre. The ply cracking models that have been assessed in the paper, for cases where they are expected to be valid, have been shown to lead to good predictions of laminate stress/strain behaviour that is consistent with data provided for the Failure Exercise. The reliability of the models is such that they have good potential for being used as the basis of new design methodology to deal with initial ply crack formation in laminates, and the effects of ply cracking on non-linear stress/strain behaviour for parts of stress/strain curves where ply cracking occurs in a single orientation.},

The analysis is based upon an accurate technique for determining the stress and displacement distributions in multiple-ply cross-ply laminates having ply cracks in one orientation. The resulting relationships governing crack formation are exceedingly simple in form involving parameters that may be defined and measured at the macroscopic laminate level, thus offering engineering methods that have great potential for use in design.

For this purpose, 3h creep followed by 3h recovery tests were performed to specimens, which have previously been subjected to a certain number of thermal cycles (from +50°C to −27°C). It was found that the variation of the reduced creep compliance of the materials considered with the number of cycles follows an exponential decay law which was independent on the time period over which the load was applied. In order to better understand such a behavior, a four elements viscoelastic model was applied and the variation of all the four elements with the number of cycles gave a better insight into the observed behavior. In addition, the viscoelastic behavior observed was correlated with the value of the degree of damage and its variation with the number of cycles. It was found that there is a damage threshold corresponding to a certain number of cycles above which damage increases rapidly reaching a plateau where saturation of micro-damage is attained.},

The properties of the composite materials studied were altered through the introduction of variations in their structure and composition. The curing agent used, matrix backbone flexibility, toughening agents, and longitudinal coefficient of thermal expansion of the reinforcing fibers were changed to investigate their role in cryogenic microcracking. Examination of the laminates after cycling provided insight into the mechanism and origins of thermal stress-induced microcracking. Matrix properties and fiber tensile modulus were shown to have a significant impact on the response of the composite materials to cryogenic cycling. It was found in this study that higher glass transition temperatures of the laminates and the presence of toughening agents in the matrix decreased the microcracking propensity of these laminates. Higher tensile moduli and linear coefficients of thermal expansion of the fibers were found to increase the microcrack density in the laminates studied.},

The structure of unidirectionally and cross-ply fibre reinforced samples was observed before and after thermal cycling by optical microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). SEM was used for examining the fibre-matrix interface before and after thermal cycling. Optical microscopy showed the arrangement of individual monolayers. The influence of adding copper foils between individual monolayers on the structure of the material is reflected in a reduction in the number of cracks in monolayers.},

The results presented here represent an extension of the work by Patel and Case (Int. J. Fatigue 22 (2000) 809). The hygrothermal aging consisted of cyclical temperature and moisture variations which were meant to simulate mission conditions for an advanced subsonic aircraft. Durability studies were carried out on the aged material system in the form of fatigue and residual strength testing under humid and elevated temperature environments. Damage mechanisms and failure modes were determined through fatigue testing, residual strength testing, and nondestructive evaluation. Changes in physical appearance, thermal analysis results, fracture surfaces, and moisture diffusion behavior all supported the idea that the material was affected by the aging process. However, experimental testing also showed that the initial and residual tensile properties of the aged material were virtually unaffected by the imposed environmental aging (as compared to unaged material testing results), except when tested at elevated temperature. At elevated temperature, both the dynamic stiffness and residual strength were noticeably reduced from that at room temperature.},

Composite specimens reinforced with ∼50{\%} or 60{\%} fibre volume fraction were thermally cycled between the temperatures of 100°C and −100°C, in a vacuum, for up to 100 cycles. Mechanical testing showed there was no change in the bending strength of samples or the associated failure mode during cycling. Composites did, however, exhibit a moderate reduction in bending modulus and interlaminar shear strength during the first few thermal cycles. Little further degradation was observed thereafter. Modifications to the matrix microstructure were examined and related to a change in matrix properties measured via microhardness testing. Composite property degradation was attributed to the formation of microvoids and interfacial sliding in the early stages of cycling. The implications these processes may have on composite application are discussed and it is concluded that based on the limited dependence of mechanical properties to thermal cycling carbon fibre reinforced magnesium shows potential for space applications operating under transient thermal conditions.},

In the present study, random variable based micro and macro-scale reliability analyses are critically compared through a limit state formulation based on the analytical stress tensor components of a rectangular simply supported orthotropic FRP composite plate and the Tsai–Hill failure criterion. The study aims to promote cross-fertilisation of alternative uncertainty modelling approaches in a multi-scale analysis framework. Propagation of uncertainty from micro to macro-scale, and the corresponding influence of changes in random variability on the reliability estimates is quantified. The importance of benchmarking experimentally-based probability distributions of mechanical properties through micro-scale modelling is illustrated, and the confidence that can be placed on reliability estimates is quantified through a series of numerical examples.},

Material for use in inflatable structures must be soft before and during unfolding and harden after unfolding. The best way for solidification of Gossamer's structures is by chemical polymerisation of a composite material in space environment. The polymerisation processes of liquid polymer matrix in a free space environment are sensitive to microgravitation, temperature variations (−150 to +150°C), high vacuum (10−3 to 10−7Pa), atomic oxygen flux (in LEO), UV and VUV irradiations, X-ray and $\gamma$-irradiations, high energy electron and ion fluxes. In this paper experiments of the photopolymerisation processes under simulated free space conditions were carried out. The influences of high vacuum, temperature variations, high energy ion beam, radio-frequency and microwave plasma on polymerisation of UV-curing resin were observed. The effects of low molecular components evaporations, acceleration of curing kinetics, additional chemical reactions and mixing processes during polymerisation were observed. The photopolymerisation of inflatable structure was carried out under simulated temperature conditions of space flight in low Earth orbit. The results indicate a technology for large-size inflatable constructions in Earth orbit, in far space and on space bodies as for deployed antennas, solar sail stringers, solar shield stringers, frames for large-size space stations, frames for Moon, Mars, asteroids bases and frames for space plant on Earth orbit and other celestial bodies.},

The experimental results were used to develop and validate a new empirical Ballistic Limit Equation (BLE), which was derived from an existing Whipple-shield BLE. This new BLE provided a good level of accuracy in predicting the ballistic performance of stand-alone sandwich panel structures. Additionally, the equation is capable of predicting the ballistic limit of a thin Al plate located at a standoff behind the sandwich panel structure. This thin plate is the representative of internal satellite systems, e.g. an Al electronic box cover, a wall of a metallic vessel, etc. Good agreement was achieved with both the experimental test campaign results and additional test data from the literature for the vast majority of set-ups investigated. For some experiments, the ballistic limit was conservatively predicted, a result attributed to shortcomings in correctly accounting for the presence of high surface density multi-layer insulation on the outer facesheet. Four existing BLEs commonly applied for application with stand-alone sandwich panels were reviewed using the new impact test data. It was found that a number of these common approaches provided non-conservative predictions for sandwich panels with CFRP facesheets.},

The results of this simulation can then be used in LRFD to determine appropriate material “knockdown” factors for use in engineering design applications.

The proposed Monte-Carlo style simulation combines a phenomenological residual strength based life prediction model for composites materials with an empirical stiffness based damage accumulation model.

abstract = {This paper aims to identify and to describe the damage mechanisms of CFRP composite laminates subjected to thermal cycling. Thermal cycling tests are performed in different atmospheres, more or less oxidative (air or oxygen) or neutral (nitrogen). Microscopic observations and weight measurements of cross-ply laminates samples, put in light a significant oxidation of the matrix when tests are carried out in oxidative environment. In such thermal loading, there exists a coupling between two degradation processes: oxidation and fatigue, which dramatically accelerates the damage build-up. In a second part of this paper, the results of some iso- and cyclic-thermal tests, on virgin or damaged specimens, are analysed in order to emphasise the coupling between the degradation mechanisms.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to characterise damage processes in carbon/epoxy laminates submitted to thermal cycling in neutral (nitrogen) and oxidative (air, oxygen) atmospheres. Observations of the polished edges of the specimens by optical microscopy and SEM have revealed the presence of matrix shrinkage and fibre/matrix debondings only on samples tested under oxidative atmospheres. Quantitative analyses of transverse matrix cracking by means of microscopy and X radiography have shown the accelerating effect of an oxidative atmosphere. Moreover, the higher the oxygen concentration, the more significant the acceleration of the cracking development. These results are analysed in terms of matrix oxidation, occurring at the highest temperatures of the cycle, and fatigue matrix cracking, occurring at the lowest ones and due to the prevented differential expansions of the plies. During a thermal cycling test performed in an oxidative atmosphere, a coupling effect between these two damage mechanisms would result in the acceleration of the micro cracking observed.},

abstract = {A Shape Memory Polymer (SMP), the tBA/PEGDMA, is used as viscoelastic core in sandwich structures. The dynamic mechanical characterization of this SMP highlights promising damping properties. The composite sandwich is developed by coupling the SMP with aluminum skins. The SMP core temperature is tuned from the Time–Temperature Superposition Principle through a rainbow calibration curve in order to correspond to optimal values of damping ratio in the frequency range of interest. The damping performances predicted by a Finite Element model are validated experimentally using modal analysis. The experimental results are found to be in good agreement with the predictions of the Finite Element model. Furthermore, it is found that the controlled heating of the SMP core allows damping the structure over a wide frequency range. The methodology which is proposed in this paper is applicable to any viscoelastic material exhibiting frequency – and temperature – dependent high damping properties.},

Elevated temperatures noticeably increase the moisture diffusion coefficient and moisture uptake behaviour. Measured changes in the tensile and in-plane shear mechanical properties were examined after 28, 56, 112 or 224days. Tensile properties remained practically unaffected by aging whereas matrix dominated shear properties revealed an initial drop which was recovered to a substantial degree after further hygrothermal aging. Visco-elastic property changes due to the superimposing mechanisms of plasticization, additional cross-linking etc. were recorded. Scanning Electron Microscopy micrographs indicate that the fibre/matrix interface remained practically intact, even after the most aggressive hot/wet aging. X-ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy analysis showed no chemical degradation incidents on the fibre reinforcement surfaces and infrared spectroscopy revealed superficial chemical alteration in the aging matrix. Optical microscopy revealed matrix cracking in samples aged at 80°C for 112days. Lastly, Computed Tomography scans of un-aged material showed internal imperfections that undoubtedly enhanced moisture transport. After aging at 60°C for 112days, Computed Tomography detected preferentially situated water pockets.},

abstract = {A study has been undertaken on the fatigue of notched carbon fibre reinforced polymers with ductile PolyPhenylene Sulfide (PPS) thermoplastic versus brittle epoxy thermoset matrix, with underlying damage mechanisms observed at micro- and mesoscopic levels. Through the comparison with a brittle matrix system (C/epoxy) tested at T{\textless}Tg, highly ductile C/PPS laminates have been tested at T{\textgreater}Tg to investigate the influence of matrix ductility on the redistribution of stresses and resulting damage mechanisms near the hole. SEM and X-rays observations provide experimental evidence to support the discussion on the specific role of matrix ductility in the delay of matrix cracking, and its contribution to slowing down inter- and intra-laminar crack propagation during fatigue loading. This mechanism seems to increase material toughness, as these matrix-rich regions at the microscopic level act as a crack barrier, resulting in localized damage in the vicinity of the hole. It can be concluded that the fatigue behaviour (wear-in) observed in unnotched ductile matrix composites shows the opposite trend (wear-out) in notched configuration.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of thermal cycles on the structural integrity of a pultruded Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP). Through a critical review of current literature alongside a comprehensive experimental campaign, the material's response to cyclic thermal loading has been ascertained, defined by the rate of degradation of its physical, mechanical and visco-elastic properties. Matching sets of both dry and soaked samples conditioned in distilled water for 224days. Freeze–thaw cycling of both dry and soaked samples was conducted between 20°C and −10°C for a total of 300 cycles. Computed Tomography scanning (CT-scan) was undertaken to assess the microstructural physical changes throughout freeze–thaw cycling. After exposure, GFRP samples exhibited a minor decrease in glass transition temperature (Tg) which indicated minor structural degradation. Dry GFRP sample's mechanical response exhibited negligible changes in both tensile and in-plane shear properties. However, as a result of the higher induced thermal stresses, soaked samples showed a significant degradation of their tensile and shear strengths. Yet, the soaked material's stiffness remained largely unaffected due to the potential reversible nature of plasticization, which acts to increase the material's molecular mobility when initially moisture-saturated, but is later recovered as the soaked samples lose moisture throughout freeze–thaw cycling.},

abstract = {A new method to characterize three-dimensional, anisotropic moisture absorption in polymeric composites using experimental gravimetric absorption data is presented. This is achieved by using the three-dimensional hindered diffusion model to recover the moisture absorption properties of composites which may exhibit Fickian or non-Fickian behavior. Effectiveness of the recovery of absorption properties is assessed using artificially generated experimental data. Anisotropic diffusivities, equilibrium moisture content (M ∞), and molecular binding ($\gamma$) and unbinding ($\beta$) probabilities that govern absorption dynamics are recovered by minimizing the difference between model predictions and experimental data. Using artificial moisture absorption data, diffusivities and M ∞ are recovered with less than 1{\%} error, whereas $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are recovered with less than 3{\%} error in the non-Fickian diffusion case. Equilibrium moisture content is shown to be accurately determined much earlier by using partial gravimetric data obtained from the initial phases of absorption, even in the presence of considerable measurement error. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Our multiscale model incorporates two distinct length scales: a coarse grid for the heat diffusion and a fine grid for the crystal morphology evolution (nucleation, growth, and impingement). Our multiscale algorithm couples the different methods on different length scales, namely, the finite volume method (FVM) on the coarse grid and the pixel coloring method on the fine grid. By using these multiscale model and multiscale algorithm, simulations for 3D polymer crystallization are carried out. Macroscopic variables, for example, temperature, relative crystallinity, as well as the microscopic structural characters, for example, crystal morphology development, and mean size of spherulites, are investigated at various cooling conditions.

The Fourier heat conduction equation, the Fick diffusion equation, the heat transfer coefficient, and the mass diffusion coefficient are chosen as the governing equations of the theoretical dry model. The calculation software, COMSOL Multiphysics, is used to complete the simulation calculation. The influence of air temperature and velocity on the heat and mass transfer processes is discussed. Results show that mass transfer dominates during the hot air drying of corn grains. Air temperature and velocity are chosen primarily in consideration of mass transfer effects.

Gravimetric, viscoelastometric and FTi.r. studies have been effected after various times of exposure. Water absorption in the polymer is essentially Fickian, although closer inspection reveals the finer behaviour to be sigmoidal. The activation energy for diffusion is of the order of 80 kJ mol−1, but there appears to be no clear relationship between equilibrium absorption values and temperature. Viscoelastometry has shown that Tg diminishes from ca. 115°C before ageing to ca. 90°C at saturation, 1{\%} of water uptake corresponding to ca. 8°C reduction in Tg. Reductions in Young's modulus were observed both in the glassy and rubbery states after ageing and the latter is associated with molecular chain scission. FTi.r. analysis has shown several modifications occurring due to water absorption, the main one being an increase in intensity of the band at 1740 cm−1. It is concluded that water absorption leads both to plasticization effects and chemical modification of the epoxy resin.},

abstract = {A robust and rapid analytical method for 3D stress analysis of composite bonded joints has been recently developed based on Mortensen's unified approach, with considerable extension to accommodate hygrothermal loads and most importantly, to compute the in-plane and out-of-plane, through-the-thickness interlaminar peel and shear stresses in the laminate adherends. Compared to other analytical methods for bonded joint analysis the present method is capable of handling more general situations, including various joint geometries, both linear and nonlinear adhesive, asymmetric and unbalanced laminates, and more general loading and boundary conditions. The formulation has been extended from strict cylindrical bending to consider generalized cylindrical bending that allows an arbitrary constant strain to be applied in the out-of-plane direction. Other analytical methods, such as Hart-Smith's, are 1-D and mainly focus on obtaining adhesive stresses, while generally ignoring stresses in laminate adherends, particularly interlaminar stresses, which are known to be key contributors to failure. Joining composite structures using adhesive bonding remains a challenging problem because performance is severely influenced by the characteristics of the composite laminate adherends, which usually have low interlaminar strengths. This new method, most importantly, computes local 3D stress fields in each ply of each adherend, which vary along the joint. Given the realistic 3D local stress fields at the ply level within each adherend, failure criteria can be employed to predict joint strength, which can facilitate better joint designs. This paper addresses the computation of stresses for composite bonded doubler joints. A companion paper, also presented in this conference, addresses failure prediction.},

The composites were based on E-glass, high seed count ECR-glass and low seed count ECR-glass fibers with modified polyester, epoxy and vinyl ester resins. The composites were exposed to a moist environment with a relative humidity of 80{\%} at 50 ??C, and their resistance to moisture absorption in terms of the rate of moisture absorption, maximum moisture content and apparent diffusivities was determined. Moisture absorption in unidirectional composite specimens was also studied numerically in this work using finite element techniques. In particular, the effects of specimen geometry (the edge effect) and specimen orthotropy on moisture absorption by the composites were evaluated. Significant differences in the moisture absorption properties of the composites were found indicating that the effect of moisture on the mechanical and electrical properties of the insulators will depend on the type of composite used. It was shown that the vinyl ester based materials had the most favorable moisture diffusion properties for use in high voltage composite insulator applications. The modified polyester based composites exhibited the worst moisture absorption performance. The epoxy-based materials had adequate rates of absorption, however, these materials did not reach equilibrium and kept slowly taking on more moisture in a non-Fickian manner. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of residual clamping stresses at the interface is considered. During fiber pull-out, Poisson contraction of the fiber in the radial direction reduces the resultant compressive stress at the interface and, hence, the interfacial frictional stress. This leads to a non-linear dependence of both the stress required for complete interfacial debonding and the stress for fiber pull-out on the embedded fiber length. Excellent agreement between present theoretical analyses and existing experimental results is obtained. Compared with the stress required for fiber pushout, where the fiber is subjected to compression in its axial direction, the stress required for fiber pullout is lower owing to Poisson's effect.},

The results show that for a bonded interface the applied axial stress on the fiber required to debond the interface depends strongly on the residual axial stress but is not sensitive to the residual radial stress. When the interface is partially debonded during fiber pull-out, the residual axial stress is relaxed in the debonded region.

The elements are formatted as user-defined elements, for compatibility with the commercial finite element software ABAQUS. The PPR, potential-based traction-separation relation is chosen to describe the element's constitutive model. The intrinsic cohesive formulation is outlined due to its compatibility with the standard, implicit finite element framework present in ABAQUS. The implementation of the cohesive elements is described, along with instructions on how to incorporate the elements into a finite element mesh. Specific areas of the user-defined elements, in which the user may wish to modify the code to meet specific research needs, are highlighted. Numerical examples are provided which display the capabilities of the elements in both small deformation and finite deformation regimes. A sample element source code is provided in an appendix, and the source codes of the elements are supplied through the website of the research group of the authors. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Prediction of crack growth path is a pre-requisite for estimating the final shape of broken solids and structures. Crack path in broken specimens provides information for the loading conditions just before fracture. Experiments on brittle materials, pre-cracked specimens of the same geometry under similar loading conditions, however, may yield different crack trajectories at times. The existing theories for the prediction of the crack path are based on the perturbation method combining the analytical and finite elements methods. They require a knowledge of the toughness equations. Moreover, they can only be applied to specimens with simple geometry and loadings. A different approach is used in the present work. The finite element technique is used to calculate the strain energy density (SED) contours. The predicted trajectory of the crack during unstable propagation is assumed to coincide with the minimum of the strain energy density function according to the SED criterion. The degree of crack path stability depends on the sharpness of the SED oscillations. This simple method offers a reliable prediction of the crack path stability for two as well as three-dimensional problems with complex geometry structures and arbitrary loadings. To be specific, both the TPB and DCB specimens are analysed. The findings are in good agreement with the theoretical and experimental results in the literature. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Managing for excellence needs effective measurement of performance. Whilst organizational performance measurement in general has been discussed extensively in the literature, few of these discussions focus specifically on the maintenance function. The overall objective of this research project is to study the role measurement can play in managing maintenance performance. In the initial phase o f the inquiry, eight maintenance organizations in Hong Kong and Canada were visited and interviews were conducted during these visits. Findings from such field work indicate that maintenance organizations seldom measure their performance using a balanced set o f indicators, or regard performance measurement as a strategic management tool. An approach that involves the use of strategy driven balanced scorecards has been proposed to enhance effectiveness of maintenance performance management.},

abstract = {This paper introduces an interface element to solve 2D progressive crack growth problems under mixed-mode loading. The interface element is developed to calculate the strain energy release rates based on the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) in conjunction with finite element analysis (FEA). A very stiff spring is placed between the node pair at the crack tip to calculate the internal forces. Dummy nodes are introduced to extract information for displacement openings behind the crack tip and the virtual crack jump ahead of the crack tip. Therefore, with this interface element, strain energy release rates ( GI and GII) can be calculated simultaneously as FEA is performed. Furthermore, with the implementation of fracture criteria, crack growth can be also directly analyzed with a fracture mechanics approach. Three classic examples for stationary cracks and three benchmark examples for static crack growth were examined. The accuracy of the element is validated by the excellent agreement with analytical solutions of these examples. No convergence difficulty has been encountered during the crack growth analyses. The fracture interface element for VCCT is, therefore, simple, efficient and robust in analyzing any 2D crack growth problems. This element has been implemented into commercial FEA software ABAQUS{\textregistered} with UEL and should be very useful in designing for enhanced structural integrity in general cases where crack initiation, crack growth, and crack arrest features are of concern. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Low profile additives (LPA) are thermoplastics that are incorporated to unsaturated polyester (UP) resins in order to improve the surface finish of UP/fibreglass composites, widely used in automotive applications. The effect of using LPA on the thermo-mechanical properties of resin transfer moulded UP/fibreglass composites is investigated. The flexural and shear properties are measured by three-point bending tests. The trend of these mechanical properties is identified for 0{\%} to 40{\%} LPA content. All the mechanical properties like flexural strength, flexural modulus and short beam strength reduce upon addition of LPA. The specimens fail by tension in the flexural test and show a mixed shear/tension failure mode in case of short beam tests. From scanning electron microscopy, morphological change of the fractured surface is observed with an LPA-rich phase. Glass transition temperature (Tg) measured by thermal mechanical analysis (TMA) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) show reproducible data and compare well with each other. Tg is improved by LPA addition due to the development of a more compatible system compared to neat resin. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is also performed to detect Tg, which gives unreliable results.},

abstract = {An extended finite element method scheme for a static cohesive crack is developed with a new formulation for elements containing crack tips. This method can treat arbitrary cracks independent of the mesh and crack growth without remeshing. All cracked elements are enriched by the sign function so that no blending of the local partition of unity is required. This method is able to treat the entire crack with only one type of enrichment function, including the elements containing the crack tip. This scheme is applied to linear 3-node triangular elements and quadratic 6-node triangular elements. To ensure smooth crack closing of the cohesive crack, the stress projection normal to the crack tip is imposed to be equal to the material strength. The equilibrium equation and the traction condition are solved by the Newton–Raphson method to obtain the nodal displacements and the external load simultaneously. The results obtained by the new extended finite element method are compared to reference solutions and show excellent agreement.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

The method is used to investigate crack growth behavior in two well-known fracture systems: the simple edge crack system and the Hertzian indentation system. It is shown that the automated incremental finite element method is accurate and reliable, and generates a crack trajectory that agrees closely with experimentally measured trajectories.

A centre-cracked specimen subjected to a uniform stress perpendicular to the crack plane is considered. A coupled stress and failure analysis is performed by using a finite element computer program based on J2-plasticity theory in conjunction with the strain energy density theory. After initial yielding, each material element follows a different equivalent uniaxial stress-strain behavior depending on the amount of energy dissipation by permanent deformation. A host of uniaxial stress-strain curves constituting parts of the same stress-strain curve were assigned to material elements for each increment of loading. The path-dependent nature of the onset of crack initiation and growth was revealed. The proposed model predicts faster crack growth rates than those obtained on the basis of a single uniaxial stress-strain curve and is closer to experimental observation. ?? 1990.},

First, the usually curved fatigue crack path and its stress-intensity factors are calculated at small crack increments in a specialized finite-element software, using automatic remeshing algorithms, special crack tip elements and appropriate crack increment criteria. Then, the computed stress-intensity factors are transferred to a powerful general-purpose fatigue-design program, which has been designed to predict both initiation and propagation fatigue lives by means of classical design methods. Particularly, its crack propagation module accepts any KI expression and any crack growth rate model, considering sequence effects such as overload-induced crack retardation to deal with 1D and 2D crack propagation under variable amplitude loading. Non-trivial application examples compare the numerical simulation results with those measured in physical experiments. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper develops the extended finite element method (XFEM) to evolve patterns of multiple cracks, in a brittle thin film bonded to an elastic substrate, with a relatively coarse mesh, and without remeshing during evolution. A shear lag model describes the deformation in three dimensions with approximate field equations in two-dimensions. The film is susceptible to subcritical cracking, obeying a kinetic law that relates the velocity of each crack to its energy release rate. At a given time, the XFEM solves the field equations and calculates the energy release rate of every crack. For a small time step, each crack is extended in the direction of maximal hoop stress, and by a length set by the kinetic law. To confirm the accuracy of the XFEM, we compare our simulation to the exiting solutions for several simple crack patterns, such as a single crack and a set of parallel cracks. We then simulate the evolution of multiple cracks, initially in a small region of the film but of different lengths, showing curved crack propagation and crack tip shielding. Starting with multiple small cracks throughout the film, the XFEM can generate the well-known mud crack pattern. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The authors have developed a novel technique to detect debonding in honeycomb sandwich structures using small-diameter fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. A small-diameter FBG sensor is embedded in the adhesive layer between the core and the facesheet during the curing process of the adhesive layer. After the curing process, the reflection spectrum from the small-diameter FBG sensor is distorted because the formation of fillets induces a non-uniform strain distribution in the adhesive layer. However, after debonding, the core with the fillets peels off the facesheet, and, as a result, the reflection spectrum recovers its original shape due to the release of the non-uniform strain. Debonding can thus be detected with high sensitivity in real time from the recovery in the shape of the reflection spectrum. In addition, a more reliable debonding detection technique using a small-diameter chirped FBG sensor is proposed, in which two indicators in the reflection spectrum have been successfully used for a more reliable judgment of debonding.},

After 40,000. cycles the fatigue test was stopped and residual properties were measured on the tested specimens. Reduction in material strength was found to depend on the level of the specimen's void content. The changes in weight and size gradually increased with an increase in porosity from 0.33{\%} to 1.50{\%} in the hygrothermal environment. It is found that the maximum rate of dimensional change occurred in the thickness direction. Both bending strength and fatigue performance were reduced with increasing porosity.

abstract = {Although they are relative newcomers to the composites industry, cyanate ester (CE) resins are enjoying unprecedented success in certain applications. Several major space and radome manufacturers have qualified CE resins despite the extensive database on epoxies and the inherently conservative nature of the industry. Increasing demands on the materials used in these areas have stimulated the use of CE resins over other more conventional polymers. The aim of this review is to bring to the reader's attention the more recent developments in the processing, toughening, properties and applications of cyanate esters, an exciting, versatile and important class of resins.},

@article{Mohan2013,
abstract = {The present work investigated the effect of the level of prepreg moisture content on the mixed-mode fracture toughness of a co-cured composite joint. It was found that moisture was stored in the prepreg as either free or bound water. It was also shown that the prepreg stores moisture from high humidity environments as free water, while the level of bound water remains unaffected. The excessive moisture was shown to plasticise the adhesive, lowering the glass transition temperature. The fracture toughness decreased under mode I and mode II loading as the humidity level was increased. There was a significant increase in mixed-mode toughness under low humidity conditions. Although the mixed-mode toughness reduced with increasing levels of humidity, the values never fell below that of the joints fabricated using the as-received materials.},

The formulation is used to solve the boundary value problem by superimposing of Mode-I and Mode-II crack problems.

abstract = {Fracture mechanics-based predictive methodologies are commonly employed to estimate onset of interlaminar damage growth in composite structures. Full implementation of interlaminar fracture mechanics in design requires the continuing development of codes to calculate energy release rates and advancements in delamination growth criteria under mixed mode conditions. In this research, an analytical crack tip element (CTE) methodology was evaluated and applied to predict skin-to-stiffener separation, which is a typical failure mode in aerospace structures. The methodology was correlated against empirical data obtained from structural testing of a single blade stiffened panel with an embedded artificial debond. Failure initiation occurred at the location predicted by the CTE and the predicted load for initiation agreed with the average of a set of experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In order to predict the fracture direction and fracture loadings of cracked materials under the general mixed-mode state, this paper presents a new general mixed-mode brittle fracture criterion based on the concept of maximum potential energy release rate (MPERR). This criterion can be easily degraded to the pure-mode fracture criterion, and can also be reduced to the commonly accepted fracture criteria for the mixed-mode I/II state. In order to validate the proposed criterion, we have carried out the experiments with aluminium alloy specimens under various mixed-mode loading conditions. The experimental results agree well with the predictions of the proposed criterion. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Simon2014,
abstract = {The finite element method is a popular numerical approach for solving solid me- chanical and other types of engineering problems. This work addresses a development of the finite element method called the eXtended Finite Element Method, or XFEM for short. This method is designed in order to simulate problems where some kind of discontinuity is present in the system's governing equations. Something that is not possible in the standard FE-method. This paper intends to outline the method's theoretical foundation, discuss the merits of the method for solving a selection of typical cases as well as evaluate a MATLAB implementation of the method that was written in conjunction with this work. Discussion points for the theoretical overview are how one or several discontinuities' geometrical properties can be efficiently stored and evaluated for different kinds of problems with the aid of a level set function, how a discontinuity's physical behavior can be described by a enrichment function and how the connection between the level set and enrichment functions and the standard FE-method works. The MATLAB program is evaluated in a series of test cases each posing a specific challenge in adapting the XFEM approach to that kind of problem.},

Those composite structures include a honeycomb sandwich structures fabricated by the cocure and the precure processes. Mass of moisture accumulated into the closed cells of the honeycomb sandwich panel specimens has been calculated. A pressure due to the vapor expansion in each cell of the sandwich panel has also been obtained for the minimum repair pressure to be applied to the laminate patched area by vapor pressure-temperature relations from the thermodynamic steam table, the ideal gas state equation and two vapor pressure equations. The bondline strengths of the laminated skins on the flat surface of honeycomb have been compared by the flatwise tension test and climbing drum peel test for dry, wet and repair-after-wet specimens, respectively. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This chapter provides the details of the input data and a description of the laminates provided to all participants in an exercise to predict the strength of composite laminates. The input data include the elastic constants and the stress strain curves for four unidirectional laminae and their constituents. Six types of laminates, chosen for the analysis are selected and described to represent a wide range of parameters. These parameters include the type of composite material (fiber and matrix), the type of laminate lay-up (unidirectional, angle ply, cross ply, and quasi-isotropic), and the loading conditions. The chapter explains the schematic diagrams showing the loading directions, layer and laminate dimensions, and stacking sequence of the laminates. The six laminates chosen for analysis by the participants are considered to be the representative of a wide range of composite laminates encountered in practical use in a variety of industries. The materials selected have been widely used in practical applications and their properties are well characterized. The chapter presents nonlinear stress-strain data and elastic constants for linear elastic analysis and discusses a wide range of practical biaxial loading conditions, which produce a variety of modes of failure. In some cases, a succession of failures may occur before the laminate can no longer carry load. In some cases, the stress-strain behavior of the laminates is expected to be linear and in some other cases, highly nonlinear.},

abstract = {As a class of important lightweight structural components, sandwich panels have gained considerable popularity in a range of engineering applications. The crashworthiness of sandwich structures, which signifies a key mechanical property under impact loading, is found largely related to shape and dimensional parameters, such as cell width, wall thickness, structural angle and core height. This study exemplifies corrugated sandwich panels with trapezoidal and triangular cores to determine the relationship between the structural parameters and the crashworthiness under low-velocity local impact and planar impact, further optimizing these structural parameters with the crashworthiness criteria by using multiobjective optimization techniques. The configurations of trapezoidal and triangular core cells are firstly optimized for maximizing energy absorption. The wall thickness of sandwich panels with optimal trapezoidal core shape is then optimized for crashworthiness. Finally, the crashworthiness of these two types of corrugated sandwich panels is compared with each other under the identical face sheet thickness and core density and it is found that the triangular configuration has better performance. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

First, the methods for evaluating interface mechanical properties are described considering micromechanical testing using single-fiber composite specimens. In particular, the test-type dependence of the obtained interfacial strength is discussed, and this paper suggests that the cruciform specimen technique is an appropriate testing method. Then, this paper presents another way to obtain interface properties that is extracted from a bulk composite test. Moreover, the time and temperature dependence of the interface strength and the interface failure envelope under a combined stress state are described, respectively.

The intrinsic cohesive zone modeling approach is employed because it can be formulated within the standard finite element framework. The implementation procedure for a two-dimensional linear cohesive element and the algorithm for the PPR potential-based model are presented in-detail. The source code of the UEL subroutine is provided in Appendix for educational purposes. Three computational examples are investigated to verify the PPR model and its implementation. The computational results of the model agree well with the analytical solutions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A study has been made of the effect of fiber misalignment and non-linear behavior of the matrix on fiber microbuckling and the compressive strength of a unidirectional fiber composite. The initial fiber misalignment constituted the combined axial and shear stress state in the matrix, and the state of stress just prior to the buckling was considered to be the initial state of stress in bifurcation analysis. The expression for the critical microbuckling stress was found to be the same as that for the elastic shear-mode microbuckling stress except that the matrix elastic shear modulus was replaced by the matrix elastic-plastic shear modulus. Incremental theory of plasticity and deformation theory of plasticity were used to model the matrix non-linearity. The analysis results showed reasonable correlation with available experimental data for AS4/3501-6 and AS4/PEEK graphite composites with 2?? to 4?? range of initial fiber misalignment. ?? 1995.},

The cracks considered parallel or with an imperceptible inclination to the longitudinal beam axis and at different distances from the upper skin interface, are analyzed with static non-linear elastic two and three dimensional finite element analyses. From the proposed analyses stress intensity factors are calculated using linear elastic fracture mechanics. It is demonstrated that the crack propagation on the compression side of the core is mainly subjected in shear. The strain energy density criterion is used in order to determine the angle of kinking of the crack into the core.},

The composite was modelled as a two-material cylinder subjected to uniform displacement and consisting of an inner cylinder simulating the fibre and a surrounding shell simulating the matrix. Using the strain energy density criterion, the critical applied displacements for crack initiation and stable crack growth were determined for three studied cases: an intact fibre, a cracked fibre, and a fully broken fibre. The numerical results were compared, where possible, to experimentally obtained ones. Finally, results concerning the variation of strain energy density versus distance from the crack tip, for the determination of the critical value of applied displacement at crack initiation, are presented and discussed.},

The composite is modeled as a two-material cylinder subjected to uniform displacement. A detailed analysis is made for the stress field in the vicinity of the debond crack tip. This approach incorporates an elastic–plastic analysis combined with a strain energy density criterion to predict debonded crack growth direction, extended stable growth and final termination. The influence of contact taking place between the debonded surfaces is also considered. It is shown that such surface contact leads to reduced stress and strain fields around the crack tip, while the extent of reduction is increased with debonding length. By combining the reduced stress field with the strain energy density criterion, a limiting value for the debonding extension can be calculated for the critical applied displacement that led to fibre fracture.},

A criterion for crack-wake debonding is proposed by treating the debonding process as a particular crack propagation problem. Then, by using an energy balance approach the formulation of the matrix cracking stress of an infinite fiber-bridged crack is derived.

Two distinct situations concerning the fiber-matrix interface are contemplated : (i) unbonded fibers initially held in the matrix by thermal or other strain mismatches, but susceptible to frictional slip, and (ii) fibers that initially are weakly bonded to the matrix, but may be debonded by the stresses near the tip of an advancing matrix crack. The results generalize those of the Aveston-Cooper-Kelly theory for case (i). Optimal thermal strain mismatches for maximum cracking strength are studied, and theoretical results are compared with experimental data for a SiC fiber, lithium-alumina-silicate glass matrix composite.},

abstract = {A matrix cracking model is developed based upon Coulomb friction law instead of a constant frictional shear stress usually assumed in the matrix cracking analyses. A Lam{\'{e}} formulation incorporated with Coulomb friction law is adopted to solve the elastic states of fiber/matrix stress-transfer through a frictionally constrained interface in the slipping region and a modified shear lag model is applied to evaluate the elastic responses in the intact region. By using an energy balance approach, the critical stress for propagating a semi-infinite fiber-bridged crack in a unidirectional fiber reinforced composite is formulated in terms of the frictional coefficient rather than the frictional shear stress usually equated in the matrix cracking stress formulations. The critical stress for matrix cracking and the corresponding stress distributions calculated by the present Coulomb friction model will be compared with those predicted by the constant frictional shear stress models. The effect of Poisson contraction caused by stress redistribution between the fiber and matrix on the matrix cracking mechanics will be shown and discussed in the present analysis.},

By adopting a shear-lag model which includes the matrix shear deformation in the bonded region and friction in the debonded region, the relationship between the fiber-closure traction and the debonded length is obtained by treating the interfacial debonding as a particular crack propagation problem along the interface. By using an energy-balance approach, the formulation of the critical stress for propagating a fiber-bridged matrix crack can then be derived. The conditions for attaining no-debonding and debonding during matrix cracking are discussed in terms of the two interfacial properties of debonding toughness and interfacial shear stress.

abstract = {A new technique for the finite element modeling of crack growth with frictional contact on the crack faces is presented. The eXtended Finite Element Method (X-FEM) is used to discretize the equations, allowing for the modeling of cracks whose geometry are independent of the finite element mesh. This method greatly facilitates the simulation of a growing crack, as no remeshing of the domain is required. The conditions which describe frictional contact are formulated as a non-smooth constitutive law on the interface formed by the crack faces, and the iterative scheme implemented in the LATIN method [Nonlinear Computational Structural Mechanics, Springer, New York, 1998] is applied to resolve the nonlinear boundary value problem. The essential features of the iterative strategy and the X-FEM are reviewed, and the modifications necessary to integrate the constitutive law on the interface are presented. Several benchmark problems are solved to illustrate the robustness of the method and to examine convergence. The method is then applied to simulate crack growth when there is frictional contact on the crack faces, and the results are compared to both analytical and experimental results.},

In this paper, we use the extended finite element method (X-FEM) to solve scales involving complex geometries. The X-FEM allows one to use meshes not necessarily matching the physical surface of the problem while retaining the accuracy of the classical finite element approach. For material interfaces, this is achieved by introducing a new enrichment strategy. Although the mesh does not need to conform to the physical surfaces, it needs to be fine enough to capture the geometry of these surfaces. A simple algorithm is described to adaptively refine the mesh to meet this geometrical requirement. Numerical experiments on the periodic homogenization of two-phase complex cells demonstrate the accuracy and simplicity of the X-FEM.},

Because of the unilateral contact condition at the debonded interfaces, the overall constitutive behavior of the composite turns out to be nonlinear even when the constituents are linearly hyperelastic. In this particular case, the homogenized free- and complementary-energy density functionals of the composite are positively homogeneous of degree two, i.e. from a mechanical point of view, the overall constitutive behavior of the composite is nonlinear conewise multimodular. Approximations of the proposed variational principles, suitable for numerical computations, are built up by adopting the finite-element method. In this way, rigorous upper bounds on the homogenized free- and complementary-energy density functionals are obtained. Then, lower bounds are derived by using the conjugacy relation between the homogenized energy density functionals.},

The cross-ply laminate is modeled by a representative volume element and the constituent materials are described by an elastic model for the fiber and a non-linear viscoelastic model for the polymer matrix. The residual stress/strain fields at the ambient temperature immediately following the cool-down and their evolution with time are determined through the viscoelastic finite element discretization of the RVE with a special consideration given to the fiber/matrix interface region. The results indicate that the residual stresses decrease with time and tend to small asymptotic values after about 34 h. However, the remaining residual strains still have significant influence on the damage evolution of the cross-ply laminate under subsequently superimposed tensile loading.},

abstract = {Cure residual stress and its effect on damage in unidirectional fibre-reinforced polymer–matrix composites under transverse loading were studied using a micromechanical unit cell model and the finite element method. The overall residual stress introduced from curing was determined by considering two contributions: volume shrinkage of matrix resin from the crosslink polymerization during isothermal curing and thermal contraction of both resin and fibre as a result of cooling from the curing temperature to room temperature. To examine the effect of residual stress on failure, a model based on the Maximum Principal Stress criterion and stiffness degradation technique was used for damage analysis of the unit cell subjected to mechanical loading after curing. Predicted damage initiation and evolution are clearly influenced by the inclusion of residual stress. Residual stress is always detrimental for transverse compressive loading and pure shear loading. For transverse tensile loading, residual stress is detrimental for relatively low resin strength and beneficial for relatively high resin strength. Failure envelopes were obtained for both biaxial normal loading and combined shear and normal loading and the results show that residual stress results in a shifting and contraction of the failure envelopes.},

It is found that stress-strain responses for the honeycombs with finite boundaries can be classified into two types: Type I and Type II. Such a characteristic is affected by the wall thickness, the work-hardening coefficient and the yield stress for the honeycombs. Furthermore, a transition from the symmetric to asymmetric deformation mode can be observed in Type I, and these deformed cells were localized in a horizontal layer. However, for the case of Type II response, the symmetric and asymmetric deformation modes can be observed simultaneously, and the region of the asymmetric mode was formed by the cell layer along the diagonal direction. As a result, the shear deformation behavior was developed along that direction. Moreover, the effect of work-hardening on the deformation behavior for the honeycombs with finite boundaries can be explained from that for infinite honeycombs.},

abstract = {A micromechanical model is presented which predicts the behaviour of a unidirectional composite subjected to axial shear load using standard finite elements. Only a three-dimensional model can handle the necessary shear loading boundary conditions when using such elements. These boundary conditions give shear stress components but no direct stress components within the composite. A parametric study is carried out on unidirectional carbon fibre/epoxy within the linear elastic regime of both constituents. The study reveals that the most critical parameters controlling the axial shear modulus of the composite are matrix modulus and fibre volume fraction whilst the stress state in the composite is mainly controlled by geometrical features of the composite, i.e., fibre volume fraction and fibre spacing. Comparison between the predicted axial shear modulus based on the concentric cylinder model and the current finite element model shows good agreement for low and intermediate fibre volume fractions. Both predictions lie within the Hashin bounds and the finite element prediction tends to be closer to the upper Hashin bound for fibre volume fractions greater than 60{\%}. The initial tangent shear modulus predicted with the finite element model and that measured differ by less than 2.5{\%}. The non-linear shear stress/strain response of the composite material is also predicted and agreement with the experimental results is good.},

A special feature of the present analyses is that extremely small values of the initial void volume fraction are considered, down to 10−10, which means that the metal undergoes huge strains before coalescence. This is accounted for in the present analyses by using remeshing techniques. The evolution of the void shape during the large deformations is a natural outcome of the numerical analysis. Also the effect of different initial void shapes is considered, as well as the effect of different spacings between the voids in the axial and transverse directions. While these first analyses are carried out for voids in a homogeneous metal, a second set of cell model studies are carried out for voids that initiate from a crack in a hard second phase particle. As the particle deforms relatively little the void growth is here dominated by strong blunting of the metal at the tip of the initial penny-shaped crack. These analyses are used to estimate how well the void shape evolution would be approximated by assuming that the presence of the particle in the material adjacent to the void can be neglected.},

abstract = {Voids are one of the most common types of manufacturing process induced defects in composite materials that have detrimental effect on the material properties. The void content can be reduced by carefully chosen process parameters, such as pressure and temperature, but often at the price of higher cost. A quantitative relationship between void characteristics and material properties would allow the trade-off between the cost and the desired product performance. The characteristics of interest include volume fraction, size, shape, and spatial distribution. In this paper, methods for determining effective elastic constants of unidirectional continuous fiber reinforced composites containing voids of various characteristics are presented. Finite element analysis (FEA) is performed on a representative volume cell based on observed void microstructure to determine the effective elastic constants. Analytical method based on Mori–Tanaka theory is also utilized for comparison. The predictions by FEA and the analytical method are compared with each other as well as with available experimental data. Overall good agreement is found. A parametric study reveals that the void content has severe impact on the out-of-plane modulus, while the in-plane properties are less significantly affected. For a given void content, the shape of the voids has different effect on different moduli. Flat voids are benign for in-plane moduli but undesirable for out-of-plane stiffness. Long voids reduce significantly the out-of-plane shear modulus, but have little effect on the in-plane properties.},

abstract = {Various curing cycles were designed to evaluate the effects of different pressure induced voids on some mechanical properties of carbon/epoxy laminates and optimum cure pressure time. A series of [0/90]3s laminates with varying void contents were fabricated and a characterization of void distribution, size, and shape within the laminates was obtained using ultrasonic c-scan and optical metallography techniques. Short beam shear, three-point flexure and tensile testing were used for mechanical evaluation and the results correlated to void volume fraction and ultrasonic absorption coefficient. The experimental results have shown that there exists an optimum time for applying pressure. The proposed grading evaluation method of ultrasonic inspection is helpful for the nondestructive examination of composites. Also, changes in mechanical performance due to porosity are consistent with previously published studies.},

It is found that the presence of a single void, ahead of crack tip, can affect the crack propagation through crack–void interaction in one-void model. As the crack–void ligament distance gradually approaches the critical distance, the crack propagation speed decreases. For two-void model, crack propagation behaviors can be substantially influenced by voids distributions (voids aligned along or perpendicular to crack line) under different crack retarding mechanisms, indicating that the distribution of voids provides a prominent role in blocking the crack propagation.},

The test enables the interfacial fracture energy to be measured for most standard sandwich constructions. The technique has been subsequently employed to investi- gate skin-core adhesion in a number of sandwich structures similar to those currently used in the marine industry. It has been shown that the interfacial fracture toughness of a GFRP-crosslinked PVC sandwich structure can be as high as 2700 j/m2; however, sandwich constructions based on balsa cores offered considerably lower values of interfacial fracture energy. Here it was found that pre-treating the balsa core prior to bonding of the composite skins has a deleterious effect on the measured fracture toughness. Finally, the results of these tests have been correlated with data obtained from conventional climbing drum and short beam shear tests.},

abstract = {A new experimental test rig has been used to measure the thermal diffusivity of a fibre-reinforced ceramic matrix composite material (C/C-SiC) using laser pulse heating under conditions of both one-dimensional and three-dimensional heat transfer. To predict these measurements, a microstructural geometric unit cell model of the material has been developed from optical micrographs and which incorporates fibre tows, matrix and interface materials. With the selection of a suitable finite-element mesh to model each material phase and the prescription of appropriate boundary conditions, this model has then been analysed for conditions of steady-stare and transient heat conduction. In this way macrothermal properties have been calculated from the micro-thermal properties of each phase of the composite. The micro-thermal properties deduced from the analyses for these thermal conditions are in close mutual agreement, and within the bounds of numerical error. These results are presented in this paper alongside the experimental measurements. It is concluded that with careful geometric modelling and sensible property data selection, the microthermal properties obtained from the unit cell model can accurately predict the experimentally measured macro-thermal properties.},

abstract = {This study is focused on the preparation and characterization of thermal properties and thermal reliability of palmitic acid (PA)/expanded graphite (EG) composite as form-stable phase change material (PCM). The maximum mass fraction of PA retained in EG was found as 80 wt{\%} without the leakage of PA in melted state even when it is heated over the melting point of PA. Therefore, the PA/EG (80/20 w/w{\%}) composite was characterized as form-stable PCM. From differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, the melting and freezing temperatures and latent heats of the form-stable PCM were measured as 60.88 and 60.81 ??C and 148.36 and 149.66 J/g, respectively. Thermal cycling test showed that the composite PCM has good thermal reliability although it was subjected to 3000 melting/freezing cycles. Fourier transformation infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic investigation indicated that it has good chemical stability after thermal cycling. Thermal conductivities of PA/EG composites including different mass fractions of EG (5{\%}, 10{\%}, 15{\%} and 20{\%}) were also measured. Thermal conductivity of form-stable PA/EG (80/20 w/w{\%}) composite (0.60 W/mK) was found to be 2.5 times higher than that of pure PA (0.17 W/mK). Moreover, the increase in thermal conductivity of PA was confirmed by comparison of the melting and freezing times of pure PA with that of form-stable composite. Based on all results, it was concluded that the form-stable PA/EG (80/20 w/w{\%}) has considerable latent heat energy storage potential because of its good thermal properties, thermal and chemical reliability and thermal conductivity. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The sandwich-fabric preforms are produced by a large-scale textile weaving process (velvet weaving). The basic mechanical properties of the sandwich core (compression and shear) were evaluated and compared with those of other core materials. There is a large variety in possible core layouts and thus mechanical performance for sandwich-fabric panels. Acceptable mechanical properties for cores of higher thickness (higher than 10 mm) can be obtained by weaving part of the pile fibres in the core under angles of ??45??, by creating networks of piles at lower degrees of stretching and sufficient pile density, or by filling the core with foam. There appears to be a strong synergistic effect between pile and foam properties in the sandwich core.},

In addition, the effect of the fiber precursor material is explored by analyzing PAN-based and pitch-based carbon fibers, both in the same type pitch-based carbon matrix. The finite element analysis is carried out at two distinct length scales: (a) a micro scale comparable with the diameter of carbon fibers and (b) a macro scale comparable with the thickness of carbon-carbon composite structures used in the thermal protection systems for space vehicles. The results obtain at room temperature are quite consistent with their experimental counterparts. At high temperatures, the model predicts that the contributions of gas-phase conduction and radiation within the micro-structural defects can significantly increase the transverse thermal conductivity of the carbon-carbon composites.},

Homogenisation is achieved by bringing multi-phase thermal properties together at the unit cell level to represent an interactive macroscopic thermal behaviour. Manufacturing porosities identified earlier through SEM analyses have also been sequentially included in the modelling scheme with three sub-models, which lead to realistic thermal conductivity values for the final composite unit cell.

abstract = {The past few decades have seen an escalation of power densities in electronic devices, and in particular in microprocessor chips. Together with the continuing trend of reduction in device dimensions this has led to dramatic increase in the thermal issues within electronic circuits. Thermal management is therefore becoming increasingly more critical and fundamental to ensuring that electronic devices operate within their specification. Although a thermal management system may make use of all modes of heat transfer to maintain temperatures within their appropriate limits and to ensure optimum performance and reliability, conductive heat transfer is typically used to spread the heat out from its point of generation and into the extended surface area of a heat sink. To minimise the contact resistance, thermal interface materials (TIMs) are introduced to the joint to fill the air gaps and are an essential part of an assembly when solid surfaces are attached together. This paper reviews the conventional interface materials and then goes on to present a comprehensive review of the emerging state-of-the-art research in the use of carbon nanotube based materials. The paper also outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each TIM category and the factors that need to be considered when selecting an interface material},

The use of the material as a medical implant grade requires a detailed understanding of the micromechanical properties which primarily define its in vivo behavior. Sterilization is a mandatory process for such materials used in medical applications like bone implants. The steam and gamma radiation sterilization processes employed in this study are at sufficient levels to affect the micromechanical properties of some polymer materials, particularly in the interphase region between the polymer matrix and the reinforcing fibers. Nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests are used in this work to reveal local gradients in the hardness and the elastic properties of the interphase regions. Both methods help to explore microscopic changes in the hardness, reduced stiffness and scratch resistance in the interphase region and in the bulk polymer matrix due to the different sterilization processes employed. The results reveal that neither steam nor gamma radiation sterilization entails significant changes of the reduced elastic modulus, hardness or coefficient of friction in the bulk polymer matrix. However, minor material changes of the PEEK matrix were observed in the interphase region. Of the two sterilization methods used, the steam treatment has a more significant influence on these small changes in this region and appears to increase slightly the thickness of the interphase zone. ?? 2006 Acta Materialia Inc.},

abstract = {An experimental study to determine the effects of thermal cycling on residual mechanical properties of a graphite/polyimide composite has been conducted. Interlaminar shear, flexure, and compression strengths were measured at room temperature and 316 °C on unidirectional and quasi-isotropic laminates subjected to 150 and 500 thermal cycles between -156 and 316°C. Thermal cycling produced transverse microcracks and delaminations in the laminates. The linear density of the microcracks (35 per cm) was about the same after 150 and 500 cycles. Although the crack density did not change from 150 to 500 cycles, crack growth did occur with intralamina cracks growing into adjacent lamina. The matrix controlled properties of the quasi-isotropic laminate at both room temperature and 316°C were reduced significantly by thermal cycling. However, the properties of the unidirectional laminate were reduced significantly only at 316°C.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to characterize radiation effects or engineering properties, dimensional stability, and chemistry on state-of-the-art composite systems. This investigation used T300/934 graphite-epoxy composite that was subjected to 1.0 MeV electron radiation for a total dose of 1.0 x 10 to the 10th rads at a rate of 5.0 x 10 to the 7th rads/hour. This simulates a worst-case exposure equivalent to 30 years in space. Mechanical testing was performed on the 4-ply unidirectional laminates over the temperature range of -25O deg F (116K) to +250 deg F (394K). A complete set of in-plane tensile elastic and strength properties were obtained. In addition electron microscopy was used to study and analyze the fracture surfaces of all specimens tested. Results indicate that little difference in properties is noted at room temperature, but significant differences are observed at both low and elevated temperatures. Dynamic-mechanical analysis showed that the glass transition temperature of the epoxy matrix was lowered by over 100 deg F (56K) after being irradiated. Thermomechanical analysis demonstrated that volatile products are produced upon heating the irradiated material. These degradation products were analyzed by infrared spectrophotometry and mass spectrometry, and found to be low molecular weight material produced by polymer chain scission and crosslink breakage. In conclusion, electron radiation acts to produce low molecular weight material in the epoxy resin matrix.},

The historical development of different attempts to strengthen the polymers all the way to the fiber-reinforcements is presented. Different materials can be used for polymer reinforcements: carbonated, aramidic, polyethylene and glass fibers, which are today most frequently used, creating composite materials with enhanced properties. Main features of the fibers in composites are greater rigidity and strength while the matrix provides the protection of the fibers as well as their position that gives the composite material the best properties. The border between the fiber and the matrix is somewhat dubious in a sense that there are often microfractures, caused by inclusion of air or impurities during the production process of composites that can weaken the mechanical properties of the material. Treating the fiber surface with adhesive agents, especially silanes, in order to enhance the grip between the fibers and polymer matrix, enhances the quality of the border.},

The moisture absorption and desorption behavior was measured at 33 different hygrothermal conditions formed from combinations of 4 temperatures (70°F, 110°F, 145°F, and 180°F) and various humidities or water immersion. From this information the diffusivity, equilibrium solubility, swelling, and diffusion modes were determined. This study revealed the presence of absorption anomalies, history dependent sorption, water immersion damage, and hygrothermally induced microcracking. These phenomena were observed to occur only for certain combinations of hygrothermal environments/material systems. In addition, other experimental studies revealed the effects of postcure, resin content, void content, and an organic coating upon moisture diffusion in advanced composite epoxy resin matrix materials.},

Various protocols such as sliding standard deviation (SD) analysis (SSA) and Pages test analysis (PTA) have been used to estimate two-dimensional (2D) kinetic rates from the time course of displacement of molecular carrier. In the current work, we compared the estimations from both SSA and modified PTA using measured data from an optical trap assay and simulated data from a random number generator. Our results indicated that both SSA and PTA were reliable in estimating 2D kinetic rates. Parametric analysis also demonstrated that such the estimations were sensitive to parameters such as sampling rate, sliding window size, and threshold. These results furthered the understandings in quantifying the biophysics of receptorligand interactions.},

abstract = {Driving mechanisms which lead to internal crack growth and failure in the thermally sprayed coatings are identified using detailed finite element models. Coatings are assumed to contain embedded cracks and they are thermally loaded according to a typical high temperature environment. In order to determine the accurate stress state, the thermal gradient within the coating is calculated from the steady-state heat transfer analysis. Our models take into account various locations of cracks, temperature-dependent and -independent plasticity, thermal conductivities of different layers and thermal insulation across crack surfaces. The results indicate that the energy release rate of large cracks can reach close to fracture toughness of ceramic coatings. We have also studied the effect of residual stresses on the fracture behavior. For a penny-shaped crack located parallel to the coating layers, a limited influence of residual stresses is observed. The effect is more pronounced when the crack orientation is perpendicular to the coating layers where it has shown a beneficial influence. In both cases, the effects of residual stresses are relevant to the cracks close to the ceramic–bond interface. In addition, we have modeled functionally graded material and investigated its mechanical influence on the embedded cracks. The implications of the present work to internal crack initiation and growth, which can lead to coating failure, are also addressed.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the general problem of crack extension in a combined stress field where a crack can grow in any arbitrary direction with reference to its original position. In a situation, when both of the stress-intensity factors,k 1,k 2 are present along the crack front, the crack may spread in any direction in a plane normal to the crack edge depending on the loading conditions. Preliminary results indicate that the direction of crack growth and fracture toughness for the mixed problem of Mode I and Mode II are governed by the critical value of the strain-energy-density factor,S cr. The basic assumption is that crack initiation occurs when the interior minimum ofS reaches a critical value designatedS cr. The strain-energy-density factorS represents the strength of the elastic energy field in the vicinity of the crack tip which is singular of the order of 1/r where the radial distancer is measured from the crack front. In the special case of Mode I crack extensionS cr is related tok 1c alone asS cr = ($\kappa$ − 1)k 1 2 /8$\mu$. In general,S takes the quadratic forma 1 1 k 1 + 2a 1 2 k 1 k 2 +a 2 2 k 2 whose critical value is assumed to be a material constant. The analytical predictions are in good agreement with experimental data on the problem of an inclined crack in plexiglass and aluminum alloy specimens. The result of this investigation provides a convenient procedure for determining the critical crack size that a structure will tolerate under mixed mode conditions for a given applied stress.},

abstract = {This paper describes a modification to the traditional Griffith energy balance as used in linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). The modification involves using a finite amount of crack extension ($\Delta$a) instead of an infinitesimal extension (da) when calculating the energy release rate. We propose to call this method finite fracture mechanics (FFM). This leads to a change in the Griffith equation for brittle fracture, introducing a new term $\Delta$a/2: we denote this length as L and assume that it is a material constant. This modification is extremely useful because it allows LEFM to be used to make predictions in two situations in which it is normally invalid: short cracks and notches. It is shown that accurate predictions can be made of both brittle fracture and fatigue behaviour for short cracks and notches in a range o different materials. The value of L can be expressed as a function of two other material constants: the fracture toughness Kc (or threshold $\Delta$Kth in the case of fatigue) and an inherent strength parameter $\sigma$0. For the particular cases of fatigue-limit prediction in metals and brittle fracture in ceramics, it is shown that $\sigma$0 coincides directly with the ultimate tensile strength (or, in fatigue, the fatigue limit), as measured on plain, unnotched specimens. For brittle fracture in polymers and metals, in which larger amounts of plasticity precede fracture, the approach can still be used but $\sigma$0 takes on a different value, higher than the plain-specimen strength, which can be found from experimental data. Predictions can be made very easily for any problem in which the stress intensity factor, K is known as a function of crack length. Furthermore, it is shown that the predictions of this method, FFM, are similar to those of a method known as the line method (LM) in which failure is predicted based on the average stress along a line drawn ahead of the crack or notch. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The problem of the interaction between a crack and a cylindrical finite-length inclusion, which is closely connected with the evaluation of the fracture toughness of short fibre reinforced plastics, was studied.The investigation was carried out by performing 3D numerical (finite elements) analysis of a specially devised model material, namely a single fibre composite cased in a fracture test specimen.The stress intensity factor distribution along the crack front was studied on varying the orientation of the inclusion, defined by the angle ?? between the inclusion axis and the normal to the crack plane. The effect of the inclusion-to-matrix stiffness ratio was also considered by studying inclusions very stiff with respect to the matrix and infinitely compliant (cavity). A parametric study was also performed.The presence of the inclusion was found to modify the stress intensity factor distribution along the crack front by introducing a peak-like distortion in front of the inclusion.For inclusions stiffer than the matrix a transition between two distinct behaviours, shielding and anti-shielding of the crack front, could be recognised on varying orientation, while for cavities an overall anti-shielding behaviour was found.A similar transition was also found on varying inclusion stiffness at fixed orientation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Criteria assuming that failure of quasi-brittle materials is affected by the stresses acting over a finite distance from the crack tip are widely used inside the scientific community. For instance, they have been applied to predict the failure load of specimens containing sharp V-notches, assuming as a critical parameter the average stress ahead the notch tip. However, this kind of approaches disregards energy balance considerations, which, as well known, are the basis of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). In order to overcome these drawbacks, the present paper uses a recently introduced finite fracture mechanics (FFM) criterion, i.e. a fracture criterion assuming that crack grows by finite steps. The length of this finite extension is determined by a condition of consistency of both energy and stress requirements; as a consequence, the crack advancement is not a material constant but a structural parameter. The criterion is applied to structures with sharp V-notches. The expression of the generalized fracture toughness, which is a function of material tensile strength, fracture toughness and notch opening angle, is given analytically. Finally, we provide comparisons with: (i) the experimental data we obtained from testing Polystyrene specimens under three point bending; (ii) some experimental data available in the literature. The agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results is generally satisfactory and, for most of the cases analyzed, the FFM predictions are better than the ones provided by the simple average stress approach. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Yang2005,
abstract = {A trend in the last decade towards models in which nonlinear crack tip processes are rep- resented explicitly, rather than being assigned to a point process at the crack tip (as in linear elastic fracture mechanics), is reviewed by a survey of the literature. A good compromise between computa- tional efficiency and physical reality seems to be the cohesive zone formulation, which collapses the effect of the nonlinear crack process zone onto a surface of displacement discontinuity (generalized crack). Damage mechanisms that can be represented by cohesive models include delamination of plies, large splitting (shear) cracks within plies, multiple matrix cracking within plies, fiber rupture or micro- buckling (kink band formation), friction acting between delaminated plies, process zones at crack tips representing crazing or other nonlinearity, and large scale bridging by through-thickness reinforcement or oblique crack-bridging fibers. The power of the technique is illustrated here for delamination and splitting cracks in laminates. A cohesive element is presented for simulating three-dimensional, mode- dependent process zones. An essential feature of the formulation is that the delamination crack shape can follow its natural evolution, according to the evolving mode conditions calculated within the sim- ulation. But in numerical work, care must be taken that element sizes are defined consistently with the characteristic lengths of cohesive zones that are implied by the chosen cohesive laws. Qualitatively successful applications are reported to some practical problems in composite engineering, which can- not be adequately analyzed by conventional tools such as linear elastic fracture mechanics and the virtual crack closure technique. The simulations successfully reproduce experimentally measured crack shapes that have been reported in the literature over a decade ago, but have not been reproduced by prior models},

@book{Liu2005a,
abstract = {Failure of a machine part (or structural part) could be attributed to many known or unknown factors. The most fundamental one is due to static overload of a structural member. The term overload might mean the structural member is subjected to a load that exceeds the ultimate strength of the material. Overload might also mean the applied load is higher than the anticipated design load of the structure, the value of which is normally set to lower than the material's ultimate strength. Inciden- tally, structural parts often fail at load levels much lower than the design load. An initial defect (or damage) in the part, cyclic load-induced cracking, or time-dependent/environmentally-assistedcrack- ing all can cause a machine part to fail prematurely. The studies of the problems and the remedies for handling the failure modes in the first two types of failures mentioned are called fracture me- chanics and fatigue; high-temperature creep, stress-corrosion, corrosion-fatigue, or hydrogen- embrittlement are the sources for the rest. Fracture mechanics is the study of the influence of loading, crack size, and structural geometry on the fracture resistance of materials containing natural flaws and cracks. When applied to design, the objective of the fracture mechanics analysis is to limit the operating stress level so that a preexisting crack would not grow to a critical size during the service life of the structure. Fatigue is the study of the effects of repeated loading on a machine part that was initially defect free, and how those loads (in combination with other factors) may shorten its anticipated life. Understanding the mech- anisms of creep and stress-corrosion/hydrogen-embrittlement is important when a machine part is intended for use in an extreme environment.},

Crack propagation in the concrete bulk is modelled by automatically inserted cohesive interface elements with nonlinear softening laws. The concrete-reinforcement interaction is also modelled by cohesive interface elements. The bond shear stress-slip relation of CEB-FIP Model Code 90 and an empirical confining stress-crack opening relation are used to characterise slip and split failure at the concrete-reinforcement interface, respectively.

This is achieved by considering the process of fatigue-crack growth as a mutual competition between intrinsic mechanisms of crack advance ahead of the crack tip (e.g., alternating crack-tip blunting and resharpening), which promote crack growth, and extrinsic mechanisms of crack-tip shielding behind the tip (e.g., crack closure and bridging), which impede it. The widely differing nature of these mechanisms in ductile and brittle materials and their specific dependence upon the alternating and maximum driving forces (e.g., Delta K and K-max) provide a useful distinction of the process of fatigue-crack propagation in different classes of materials; moreover, it provides a rationalization for the effect of such factors as load ratio and crack size. Finally, the differing susceptibility of ductile and brittle materials to cyclic degradation has broad implications for their potential structural application; this is briefly discussed with reference to lifetime prediction.},

Due to complexity of the damage processes at a stress raiser in a composite, different modeling approaches have been developed, ranging from empirical point and average stress criteria to involved damage mechanics or cohesive zone-based models of failure. Finite fracture mechanics approach with a coupled stress and energy failure criterion, recently developed and applied mainly to cracking in homogeneous isotropic materials, allows predicting the appearance and propagation of a crack using material strength and toughness characteristics obtained from independent tests. The present study concerns application of the finite fracture mechanics to the analysis of cracking at a notch in a UD glass/epoxy composite subjected to tensile off-axis loading. Based on UD composite strength and intralaminar toughness characterized by separate tests, finite fracture mechanics analysis provided conservative estimates of crack onset stress at the notch. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The presence of surface and internal cracks in monolithic and composite materials is known to reduce the fracture strength of the material. Due to the inherent complexity of composites, a wide array of fracture analysis has been developed to quantify the stress field at the crack tip. In this paper, an expression of instantaneous evaluation of J-Integral (Paris and Paris, 1988 [1]; Williams, 1987 [2]; Nilsson, 2006 [3]) is compared to finite element output as a method of analysis for the Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of composite materials for large displacements of the double cantilever beam using empirical data. The outputs of the proposed exact method and finite element method are also compared with two ASTM methods; Modified Beam Theory (MBT) and Modified Compliance Calibration (MCC) methods. The results show close alignment with MBT method and MCC method, and therefore, suggest that the exact (J-integral) method may be used as an alternative over relatively costly and time consuming testing procedures for evaluating fracture toughness of fiberglass-epoxy composites. In addition, finite element simulations show relatively constant value of fracture toughness as compared to exact method, MBT method, and MCC method if extracted remotely from the crack tip.},

The analytical formulations are developed in terms of Fourier transforms and the solution of the resulting singular integral equations by using Chebyshev polynomials. In this study, we examine the effect of the gradient of material properties and the speed of crack propagation upon the stress intensity factors, the strain energy release rate and the crack opening displacement. The results reveal that although the singular stress field around the tip of a crack in this FGM is governed by the traditional square root singularity, significant discrepancy in the local stress field exist between it and a homogeneous solid. This indicates that the presence of a gradient in the mechanical properties affects the local stress distribution significantly and, ultimately, the fracture behaviour of the solid. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {A finite element methodology is developed for fracture analysis of orthotropic functionally graded materials (FGMs) where cracks are arbitrarily oriented with respect to the principal axes of material orthotropy. The graded and orthotropic material properties are smooth functions of spatial coordinates, which are integrated into the element stiffness matrix using the isoparametric concept and special graded finite elements. Stress intensity factors (SIFs) for mode I and mixed-mode two-dimensional problems are evaluated and compared by means of the modified crack closure (MCC) and the displacement correlation technique (DCT) especially tailored for orthotropic FGMs. An accurate technique to evaluate SIFs by means of the MCC is presented using a simple two-step (predictor-corrector) process in which the SIFs are first predicted (e.g. by the DCT) and then corrected by Newton iterations. The effects of boundary conditions, crack tip mesh discretization and material properties on fracture behavior are investigated in detail. Many numerical examples are given to validate the proposed methodology. The accuracy of results is discussed by comparison with available (semi-) analytical or numerical solutions. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Analysis has been performed on fracture initiation near a crack in a brittle material with strength described by Weibull statistics. This nonlocal fracture model allows for a direct correlation between near crack-tip stresses and failure. Predictions are made for both the toughness and average fracture initiation angle of a crack under mixed-mode loading. This is pertinent for composites and is especially interesting for functionally graded materials (FGMs), where the stress and strength fields vary from the homogeneous form away from the crack tip. 'Both analytic and finite element analyses of FGMs reveal that gradients in Weibull scaling stress ??o(x,y) usually lead to a dramatic decrease of initiation fracture toughness; moreover, gradients normal to the crack result in a crack growing toward the weaker material. When comparing FGMs with gradients in Young's modulus in the direction of the crack path, E(x), and the same stress-intensity factor K, the crack growing into the steeper negative gradient will be tougher, if m, the Weibull modulus, is low; with growth in the stiff direction, the effect is opposite. These effects offset the higher-stress intensity for cracks growing into more compliant material, and the crack-tip shielding when growing into a stiffer material based upon expectations for the applied load. Perpendicular gradients in modulus can cause a far-field mode I loading to produce mixed-mode loading of the crack tip and other asymmetric adjustments in the stress field; the gradient induces non-coplanar cracking that depends strongly on m. The distribution of damage near a crack tip will vary strongly with m. For high materials, failure is dominated by the very near-tip parameters, and effects of gradients are minimized. With low m, distributed damage leading to toughening can be exaggerated in FGMs. Finally, consideration is given to the role of several higher-order terms in the stress field. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Thermal fracture behavior of metal/ceramic functionally graded materials (FGMs) was evaluated by a well controlled burner heating method using a H2/O2 combustion flame, which simulated real environment. Partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ)/IN100 FGMs having finely mixed microstructures and PSZ/Inco718 FGMs having rather coarse microstructures were prepared by a slurry dipping and HIP sintering process. Also, three types of functionally graded thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) as well as duplex coatings, each designed to have the same thermal resistance, were fabricated by an air plasma spraying process. The fracture mechanism has been discussed on the basis of the crack morphology, the analysis of acoustic emissions and the variation of effective thermal conductivity. The thermal shock fracture behavior is discussed on PSZ/In 100 FGMs and PSZ/Inco 718 FGMs, while the cyclic fracture behavior is discussed on plasma sprayed coatings. The cyclic fracture behavior is found to be: orthogonal crack formation on the top surface during cooling, then transverse crack formation in the graded layer during heating, and subsequent growth of transverse cracks and their coalescence which eventually causes the ceramic coat to spall. Compared to duplex coatings, it has been revealed that functionally graded TBCs possess the desirable effect for improvement of spallation life under cyclic thermal loads. The dependence of spallation life on composition profile in functionally graded coatings has been discussed. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper addresses some fundamental theoretical and numerical issues concerning the application of effective properties for the failure analysis of microstructured materials, with a focus on functionally graded materials. An edge-cracked square region is considered which is taken to be on the size of a representative volume element in a larger structural system. The region is made functionally graded by utilizing a non-homogeneous probability density function (PDF) governing the spatial distribution of the constituents. The non-homogeneity of the PDF exists only in the direction of the crack plane. Based upon the type of microstructure considered in the region, an accurate homogenization method is employed to obtain effective properties. For functional forms of the PDF, energy release rates and stress intensity factors (SIFs) are then calculated using both effective properties based on pointwise homogenization and realizations of specific microstructures generated from the PDF. For all calculations, we employ the eXtended finite element method, alleviating the need to remesh the domain between different microstructural realizations. Enrichment strategies are employed by the method to capture the singular stress fields near the crack tip as well the discontinuous strain fields at fiber-matrix interfaces, even with relatively coarse meshes. SIFs are calculated using a domain form of the J-integral that does not exhibit any domain dependence. The results show excellent agreement between the implicit and the mean of the explicit trials for the energy release rates and strain energy densities. The results also seem to indicate that the implicit SIFs predict the mean SIF of the explicit trials for an arbitrary initial crack geometry. Furthermore, the results indicate that a good approximation of the SIF at specific crack tips may be estimated by reinterpreting the implicit results according to knowledge of the distinct crack-tip location in the microstructure. Quasistatic crack growth studies are performed to investigate the probability of finding crack tips within either of the composite phases. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The relationship between the effective thermoelastic properties of composites and those of their constituents is studied. Bounds are derived for the effective thermal expansion coefficients and specific heats of multiphase anisotropic composites having anisotropic constituents.

abstract = {Thermal expansion coefficients play an important role in the design and analysis of composite structures. A detailed analysis of thermo-mechanical distortion can be performed on microscopic level of a structure. However, for a design and analysis of large structures, the knowledge of effective material properties is essential. Thus, either a theoretical prediction or a numerical estimation of the effective properties is indispensable. In some simple cases, exact analytical solutions for the effective properties can be derived. Moreover, bounds on the effective values exist. However, in dealing with complex heterogeneous composites, numerical methods are becoming increasingly important and more widely used, because of the limiting applicability of the existing (semi-)analytical approaches. In this study, finite-element methods for the calculation of effective thermal expansion coefficients of composites with arbitrary geometrical inclusion configurations are discussed and applied to a heterogeneous lightning protection coating made from Dexmet{\textregistered} copper foil 3CU7-100FA and HexPly{\textregistered} epoxy resin M21. A short overview of some often used (semi-)analytical formulas for effective thermal expansion coefficients of heterogeneous composites is given in addition.},

abstract = {The aim of this article was to investigate the effects of vacuum thermal cycling on mechanical and physical properties of high performance carbon/bismaleimide (BMI) composites used in aerospace. The changes in dynamic mechanical properties and thermal stability were characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. The changes in linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) were measured in directions perpendicular and parallel to the fiber direction, respectively. The outgassing behavior of the composites were examined. The evolution of surface morphology and surface roughness were observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Changes in mechanical properties including transverse tensile strength, flexural strength and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) were measured. The results indicated that the vacuum thermal cycling could improve the crosslinking degree and the thermal stability of resin matrix to a certain extent, and induce matrix outgassing and thermal stress, thereby leading to the mass loss and the interfacial debonding of the composite. The degradation in transverse tensile strength was caused by joint effects of the matrix outgassing and the interfacial debonding, while the changes in flexural strength and ILSS were affected by a competing effect between the crosslinking degree of resin matrix and the fiber-matrix debonding. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {10.1177/1056789507081688 A micromechanical two-level elastoplastic evolutionary damage model is proposed to predict the overall transverse mechanical behavior and interfacial damage evolution of fiber-reinforced ductile matrix composites. Progressive partially debonded cylindrical isotropic long fibers are replaced by equivalent orthotropic yet perfectly bonded elastic cylindrical inclusions. Up to three interfacial fiber debonding damage modes in two dimensions are considered. The effective elastic moduli of five-phase composites, composed of a ductile matrix, randomly located yet unidirectionally aligned cylindrical fibers, and equivalent (damaged) cylindrical fibers, are derived by using a micromechanical formulation. In order to characterize the overall transverse elastoplastic damage behavior, an effective yield criterion is derived based on the statistical ensemble-area averaging process and the first-order effects of eigenstrains upon overall yielding. The proposed effective yield criterion, together with the overall plastic flow rule and the hardening law, constitute the 3-D analytical homogenization framework for the estimation of effective elastoplastic damage responses of metal matrix composites containing both perfectly bonded and partially debonded aligned cylindrical fibers randomly located in the matrix. Further, the Weibull's probabilistic function is employed to describe the varying probability of progressive partial cylindrical fiber debonding. The proposed micromechanical elastoplastic damage formulation is applied to the transverse uniaxial and varied stress ratios of transverse biaxial tensile loading to predict the various stress{\^{a}}strain responses under the plane-strain condition. Efficient computational algorithms are also presented to implement the proposed elastoplastic damage model. Finally, comparison between the present predictions and available experimental data and other simulations are performed to illustrate the potential of the proposed framework.},

Structure stability and compatibility of core and coating materials were also tested by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR), and the surface morphology of the samples are shown by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). It has been found that the microencapsulated paraffin waxes show little change in the latent heat of fusion and melting temperature after one thousand thermal recycles.

Under the simulated LEO space environment, graphite/epoxy composites, which are widely applied to space structures, were tested to study the LEO space environment effects on the composites. Tensile properties, as well as mass loss of the graphite/epoxy composites, after being exposed to AO atmosphere and the synergistic LEO space environment, were investigated. The surface morphology of the composites under LEO space environment effects was also observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Experimental results showed that LEO environment and its synergistic effects cause considerable damage to the surface of composites.},

abstract = {A vigorous mechanics foundation is established for using a representative volume element (RVE) to predict the mechanical properties of unidirectional fiber composites. The effective elastic moduli of the composite are determined by finite element analysis of the RVE. It is paramount in such analyses that the correct boundary conditions be imposed such that they simulate the actual deformation within the composite; this has not always been done previously. In the present analysis, the appropriate boundary conditions on the RVE for various loading conditions are determined by judicious use of symmetry and periodicity conditions. The non-homogeneous stress and strain fields within the RVE are related to the average stresses and strains by using Gauss theorem and strain energy equivalence principles. The elastic constants predicted by the finite element analysis agree well with existing theoretical predictions and available experimental data.},

abstract = {Two typical idealised packing systems have been employed for unidirectionally fibre reinforced composites, viz. square and hexagonal ones. A systematic approach has been adopted and it involves the use of only the translational symmetry transformations. There are a number of important advantages resulting from this. The unit cells so derived are capable of accommodating fibres of irregular cross-sections and imperfections asymmetrically distributed around fibres such as microcracks and local debonding in the system, provided the regularity of the packing and imperfections is present. Furthermore, all the unit cells established can be subjected to arbitrary combinations of macroscopic stresses or strains unlike most available unit cells in the literature which can only deal with individual macroscopic stress or strain components. Boundary conditions for these unit cells have been derived from appropriate considerations of the conditions of symmetry transformations. Applications of macroscopic stresses or strains as the loads to the unit cells have been described in such a way that they can be implemented in a straightforward manner and the effective properties of the composite can be evaluated following a standard procedure. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Micromechanical modeling is based on elastic solutions for basic loadcases including prescribed axial tension, transverse hydrostatic loading, axial and in-plane shear, and unconstrained thermal expansion. The composite cylinder assemblage model (Hashin, 1990) is utilized to predict axial elastic properties, transverse bulk modulus and thermal expansion coefficients of the overall composite. The effective transverse shear modulus is evaluated using a self-consistent method. The approach is illustrated by considering a representative carbon/carbon material system containing pyrolytic carbon matrix of two different texture levels. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A new analysis for stress transfer from the fiber to the matrix through an imperfect interface was derived using a Bessel-Fourier series. The new analysis is specific for the fragmentation test. It satisfies equilibrium and compatible every place and satisfies most boundary conditions exactly. The only approximation is the axial stress boundary condition in the fiber which is satisfied in an averaged sense instead of exactly. Two important advantages of the stress transfer analysis are that it can analyze anisotropic fibers and it can include imperfect interfaces or interphases. Theoretical predictions of stress stress transfer were compared to experimental Raman spectroscopy results. The predictions agree well experiments and they can be used to measure interface properties. The stress transfer analysis was coupled with an interfacial failure criterion to model the fragmentation test. The results of modeling fragmentation data as a function of applied strain suggested new ways of interpreting fragmentation experiments and cast doubt on the relevance of the commonly measured interfacial shear strength.},

Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the composites without heat treatment decreased clearly in the two temperature ranges of 1300-1500 C and 2100-2500 C. Raman spectra and scanning electron microscope analyses of the composites heat treated at different temperatures showed that the reduction of structural defects in fibers, and the graphitization of carbon matrix were responsible for the decrease of CTE. Furthermore, fiber/matrix interfacial debonding and fiber pull-out during the CTE measurement occurred with the increase of heat treatment temperature up to 1500 C, while at higher heat treatment temperature, circumferential cracks and layer bridging in the matrix were observed.

abstract = {Dealing with the "French Supersonic Aircraft Research Program", thermal cycling tests in two environments, neutral (nitrogen) and oxidative (air), were performed on three different carbon/epoxy laminates: [03/903]S, [453/-453]S and QI [45/0/-45/90]S. This experimental study was conducted following a local approach through microscopic observations and X-radiographs and showed a significant effect of the oxygen level on the damage development. In fact, observations have shown an acceleration of matrix cracking process and important matrix shrinkage due to coupling between oxidation phenomenon and cyclic thermal stresses. Moreover, the influence of orientation and thickness of the layers on the damage has been demonstrated through the comparison of the different stacking sequences. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Gale1999,
abstract = {Objectives: Exposure of restorations in extracted teeth to cyclic thermal fluctuations to simulate one of the many factors in the oral environment has been common in many tracer penetration, marginal gap and bond strength laboratory tests. Temperature changes used have rarely been substantiated with temperature measurements made in vivo and vary considerably between reports. Justification and standardization of regimen are required. Data, sources and study selection: An assessment of reports describing temperature changes of teeth in vivo is followed by an analysis of 130 studies of laboratory thermal cycling of teeth by 99 first authors selected from 25 journals. A clinically relevant thermal cycling regimen was derived from the in vivo information, and is suggested as a benchmark standard. Conclusions: Variation of regimens used was large, making comparison of reports difficult. Reports of testing the effects of thermal cycling were often contradictory, but generally leakage increased with thermal stress, although it has never been demonstrated that cyclic testing is relevant to clinical failures. However, should this be done, the standard cyclic regimen defined is: 35??C (28 s), 15??C (2 s), 35??C (28 s), 45??C (2 s). No evidence of the number of cycles likely to be experienced in vivo was found and this requires investigation, but a provisional estimate of approximately 10 000 cycles per year is suggested. Thermal stressing of restoration interfaces is only of value when the initial bond is already known to be reliable. This is not the case for most current restorative materials. ?? 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},
