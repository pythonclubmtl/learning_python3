abstract = "Flexible graphene film can be quickly realized by three-dimensional printing (3D printing), which has the potential in functional electronic devices. With a trace of cobalt ions as crosslinker, the graphene oxide sol can be converted into 3D printed ink, overcoming the disadvantage of insufficient viscosity of pure graphene oxide ink. The various graphene architectures were successfully obtained by 3D printing, moreover, graphene/polyaniline composites were obtained by electropolymerization. The specific capacitance of graphene/polyaniline electrode achieved up to 238 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g, which was much higher than that of graphene electrode (35 F/g)."
